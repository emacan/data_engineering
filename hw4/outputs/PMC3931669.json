        "abstract": "<p>Financial stress may have adverse health effects. The main aim of this study was to investigate whether having a cash margin and living alone or cohabiting is associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.</p>\n<p>Representative population-based prospective cohort study of 60-year-old women (n\u2009=\u20092065) and men (n\u2009=\u20091939) in Stockholm County, Sweden. National registers were used to identify cases of incident CVD (n\u2009=\u2009375) and all-cause mortality (n\u2009=\u2009385). The presence of a cash margin was determined in the questionnaire with the following question: Would you, if an unexpected situation occurred, be able to raise 10 000 SEK within a week? (This was equivalent to US$ 1250 in 1998).</p>\n<p>Compared with cohabiting women with a cash margin, the risk of all-cause mortality was higher among cohabiting women without a cash margin, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.97 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06\u20133.66). Using cohabiting men with cash margin as referent, single men without a cash margin were at an increased risk of both incident CVD and all-cause mortality: HR 2.84 (95% CI 1.61\u20134.99) and 2.78 (95% CI 1.69\u20134.56), respectively. Single men with cash margins still had an increased risk of all-cause mortality when compared with cohabiting men with a cash margin: HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.22\u20132.28).</p>\n<p>Financial stress may increase the risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, especially among men. Furthermore these risks are likely to be greater in men living in single households and in women without cash margins. Living with a partner seems to protect men, but not women, from ill-health associated with financial stress due to the lack of a cash margin.</p>",

                            "<p>Financial stress may increase the risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, especially among men.

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted. The immediate health effects of the 2008 financial crisis which lead to increases in unemployment and that many families had to leave their mortgaged homes, were followed by a rise in suicide rates but a reduction in traffic accidents [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. In addition to the direct effects of financial stress, more long-term harmful effects on health are likely. Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, all participants underwent thorough investigation and we were able to adjust baseline characteristics for a number of covariates. Furthermore, both women and men were included in the study. All participants were of the same age (60\u00a0years), making age-adjustments unnecessary, and the study was conducted over a period of one and half a year. Finally, the In Hospital Care Register and the Cause of Death Register in Sweden are nearly complete (99.8%) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], enabling long-term evaluation without any significant loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>",

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted. The immediate health effects of the 2008 financial crisis which lead to increases in unemployment and that many families had to leave their mortgaged homes, were followed by a rise in suicide rates but a reduction in traffic accidents [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. In addition to the direct effects of financial stress, more long-term harmful effects on health are likely. Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

The question asked to investigate the association was: \u201cWhat level of financial stress have you felt in the last 12 months?\u201d Participants were given three possible answers: 1) Little/None; 2) Moderate; or 3) High/Severe. Unemployment is a likely cause of financial stress. Individuals without a cash margin, as defined in the present study were also less likely to be employed, and are thus likely to have answered High/Severe. However, participants in the present study reporting having a cash margin may have relied on the possibility of borrowing money from friends or family if necessary, an aspect not included in the financial stress question of the INTERHEART study.</p>",
                            "<p>Findings from another case\u2013control study of myocardial infarction revealed that low socioeconomic position is associated with myocardial infarction in men and women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The increased risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality seen in the present study in single men is alarming, as the relative risks of these outcomes has been shown to be doubled in men regardless of blood pressure level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, all participants underwent thorough investigation and we were able to adjust baseline characteristics for a number of covariates. Furthermore, both women and men were included in the study. All participants were of the same age (60\u00a0years), making age-adjustments unnecessary, and the study was conducted over a period of one and half a year. Finally, the In Hospital Care Register and the Cause of Death Register in Sweden are nearly complete (99.8%) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], enabling long-term evaluation without any significant loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>",

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted. The immediate health effects of the 2008 financial crisis which lead to increases in unemployment and that many families had to leave their mortgaged homes, were followed by a rise in suicide rates but a reduction in traffic accidents [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. In addition to the direct effects of financial stress, more long-term harmful effects on health are likely. Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

Unemployment is a likely cause of financial stress. Individuals without a cash margin, as defined in the present study were also less likely to be employed, and are thus likely to have answered High/Severe. However, participants in the present study reporting having a cash margin may have relied on the possibility of borrowing money from friends or family if necessary, an aspect not included in the financial stress question of the INTERHEART study.</p>",

In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted.

Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, all participants underwent thorough investigation and we were able to adjust baseline characteristics for a number of covariates. Furthermore, both women and men were included in the study.

Finally, the In Hospital Care Register and the Cause of Death Register in Sweden are nearly complete (99.8%) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], enabling long-term evaluation without any significant loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Financial stress may increase the risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, especially among men.

                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study.

In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].

                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",

Unemployment is a likely cause of financial stress. Individuals without a cash margin, as defined in the present study were also less likely to be employed, and are thus likely to have answered High/Severe.

In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, all participants underwent thorough investigation and we were able to adjust baseline characteristics for a number of covariates.

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted.

Financial stress may also lead to a lower socio-economic status, which is a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as other adverse health outcomes and all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. Other studies have shown that men and women may be affected differently in their contacts with health care if they are single or living with a partner, where single men have been shown to be vulnerable and less likely to seek healthcare [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. Moreover, men and women have been shown to have different lifestyle patterns and divergent risks for cardiovascular disease and mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], which suggest that they should be studied independently.</p>",

In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted.

Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

HDL-cholesterol in serum was measured enzymatically after isolation of LDL and VLDL (Boehringer Mannheim Gmbh, Germany) and LDL-cholesterol was estimated using the Friedewald formula. Serum glucose was measured with an enzymatic colorimetric test (Bayer Diagnostics). The presence of CVD and diabetes at the baseline investigation were determined using the questionnaire. CVD at baseline was identified by prior CVD-events in the national hospital discharge register or as having reported one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or angina (heart or legs) in the questionnaire. We also excluded individuals with missing data on any these questions in the questionnaire.

Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",

Due to the recent and current financial turbulence in many parts of the world, including Europe, Japan and the USA, studies of the potential health hazards associated with individual-level financial stress are warranted. The immediate health effects of the 2008 financial crisis which lead to increases in unemployment and that many families had to leave their mortgaged homes, were followed by a rise in suicide rates but a reduction in traffic accidents [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. In addition to the direct effects of financial stress, more long-term harmful effects on health are likely. Perceived stress in midlife has for example been shown to be associated with disability in a long-term follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

Unemployment is a likely cause of financial stress. Individuals without a cash margin, as defined in the present study were also less likely to be employed, and are thus likely to have answered High/Severe. However, participants in the present study reporting having a cash margin may have relied on the possibility of borrowing money from friends or family if necessary, an aspect not included in the financial stress question of the INTERHEART study.</p>",

                            "<p>The increased risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality seen in the present study in single men is alarming, as the relative risks of these outcomes has been shown to be doubled in men regardless of blood pressure level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. In a study of hypertension control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was observed that men with diagnosed hypertension who avoided healthcare because of the cost had high odds of having uncontrolled hypertension. Together, these results indicate a need to assist and help men in their contacts with healthcare, especially those living alone under financial stress.</p>",
                            "<p>There are several possible explanations for the findings of the present observational study. First, living under financial stress contributes to feelings of inferiority, loss of status, self-doubt and deprivation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. In modern society, money is important for social interaction. Hence, living under financial stress might increase the likelihood of being socially excluded. Experiences of low social status and lack of money have been associated with elevated night-time catecholamine levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], and might produce emotions such as shame which in turn lead to ill-health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In fact, it has proposed that the feeling of shame might be one of the most powerful and recurrent sources of chronic stress not only leading to ill-health but also to a wide range of infectious diseases and CVD [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Second, individuals experiencing financial stress may be pre-occupied by their struggle to remain solvent and may as a consequence pay less attention to their health. The incentive to spend money on healthy foods and time on physical activity may also be reduced in individuals without cash margins as they are primarily concerned with financial worries, rather than health matters [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Third, it is also possible that individuals without a cash margin are more likely to live in deprived areas, in which crime rates are higher and education and income levels are lower, which may make them more vulnerable to neighbourhood-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. Such risk has been associated with coronary heart disease beyond the individual-level risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Fourth, high alcohol consumption was higher in single men without cash margin, and the physical activity level and the intake of vegetables were lower in single individuals without a cash margin. Furthermore, these subjects in this group were more often smokers than those in other groups. Lifestyle factors and psychological stress combined have been associated with loss of telomere length [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>], and it is possible that such mechanisms may be in operation as well in this study explaining the reductions in all-cause mortality.</p>",
                            "<p>Fifth, financial stress may result in a physiological acute stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), also known as allostasis. Long-term effects of allostasis combined with a sedentary lifestyle result in a build-up of a cluster of risk factors known as allostatic load, and have been defined by certain scores [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Allostatic load scores may be regarded as a \u201cprice to pay for adaptations\u201d, and have often included elevated blood pressure, blood lipids, higher levels of catecholamines, poor glycemic control, increased waist, and non-normal cortisol levels [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Allostatic load may also be seen as the wear and tear of the body and high scores have been associated with poor self-rated health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>], physical and cognitive decline, and with incident cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Finally, besides the fact that men are less prone to seek healthcare and to follow their doctors\u2019 recommendations as mentioned above, we can only speculate why single men and women, as well as single and cohabiting men have different risks. Stressful events in early life have been shown to have a greater effect on psychosocial function late life in men than in women [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>], and it is possible that these effects contribute to and propagate the divergent risks associated with cash margin/cohabiting in men and women. It is also possible that men are more affected socially and thus have more financial stress, than women are when they lack cash margin.</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Awareness of the health effects of financial stress would help doctors to identify individuals at high risk of incident CVD and all-cause mortality in general. This is also of importance public health when planning health resources on a population level. Many countries including Sweden have a system approaching socialised medicine and, despite this, psychosocial factors has repeatedly been shown to be of importance for health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. In a society with equal opportunities for health screening and intervention, more effort should be directed towards identification of vulnerable groups such as those living alone and or under financial stress. According to Statistics Sweden (<ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.scb.se\">http://www.scb.se</ext-link>), the number of women living alone increased between 2000 and 2009, from 1.07 to 1.11 million, whereas the number of single men increased from 0.96 to 1.14 million over the same period (the total population in Sweden was 9.3 million in 2009). Furthermore, data from Statistics Sweden show that 19.3% of adult women and 15.3% of adult men did not have a cash margin in 2010 (15 000 SEK; equivalent to approximately US$ 2200).</p>",
                            "<p>This study has several limitations that should be considered. Because of limits to the ethical approval, we were not able to analyse cancer risks or make adjustments for psychiatric hospitalisations. However, we had the opportunity to study all-cause mortality, which is the most reliable outcome. Our study involved only one assessment of cash margin and the risk factors for incident CVD and all-cause mortality, whereas repeated investigations could have resulted in more accurate data. However, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the predictive value of single assessments of cash margin and cohabiting after 60 years of age. Most healthcare screenings are based only on single measurements of various risk factors and lifestyle behaviours.</p>",
                            "<p>This study also has a number of strengths. We were able to reach the target population (60-year-old residents of Stockholm County) with a high response rate (78%); however, the response rate was likely lower in individuals with a low cash margin, possibly making the real effects of our findings in the population even greater.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, all participants underwent thorough investigation and we were able to adjust baseline characteristics for a number of covariates. Furthermore, both women and men were included in the study.

Finally, the In Hospital Care Register and the Cause of Death Register in Sweden are nearly complete (99.8%) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], enabling long-term evaluation without any significant loss to follow-up [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Financial stress may increase the risks of incident CVD and all-cause mortality, especially among men.

Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured after 5 minutes of rest; the mean value of two measurements was calculated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. Blood samples were drawn in the morning after overnight fasting. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum were analysed using enzymatic methods (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA). HDL-cholesterol in serum was measured enzymatically after isolation of LDL and VLDL (Boehringer Mannheim Gmbh, Germany) and LDL-cholesterol was estimated using the Friedewald formula. Serum glucose was measured with an enzymatic colorimetric test (Bayer Diagnostics). The presence of CVD and diabetes at the baseline investigation were determined using the questionnaire. CVD at baseline was identified by prior CVD-events in the national hospital discharge register or as having reported one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or angina (heart or legs) in the questionnaire. We also excluded individuals with missing data on any these questions in the questionnaire. Diabetes (mainly type 2 diabetes) was defined as self-reported diabetes, use of anti-diabetic medication or a fasting serum glucose level \u22657.0\u00a0mmol/l (for cases diagnosed at the baseline examination) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Employment was coded as working half-time or more (yes/no). Participants were categorised as never smokers, ex-smokers/occasional smokers and current daily smokers [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. High alcohol consumption was estimated based on a questionnaire on beer, wine and hard liquor consumption [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>], shown to be valid in detecting of high consumers of alcohol [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. Physical activity was defined as moderate or intensive leisure time physical activity more than once a week and determined by questionnaire. Daily intake of fruit and vegetables were also determined from the questionnaire. The answers of these questions were transformed into dichotomous variables. Education level was defined as: Lower level education, i.e. compulsory school, 10\u2009\u2212\u200912-year education, i.e. high school, and &gt;12-year education, i.e. university. Cohabiting was defined as living with a partner or being married.</p>",
