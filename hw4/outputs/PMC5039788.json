        "title": "Influence of dosing times on cisplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats",
        "abstract": "<p>Although <italic>cis</italic>-diamminedichloro-platinum (CDDP) exhibits strong therapeutic effects in cancer chemotherapy, its adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and vomiting are dose-limiting factors. Previous studies reported that chronotherapy decreased CDDP-induced nephropathy and vomiting. In the present study, we investigated the influence of dosing times on CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats.</p>\n<p>CDDP (4\u00a0mg/kg) was administered intravenously at 5:00 or 17:00 every 7\u00a0days for 4\u00a0weeks to male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, and saline was given to the control group. To assess the dosing time dependency of peripheral neuropathy, von-Frey test and hot-plate test were performed.</p>\n<p>In order to estimate hypoalgesia, the hot-plate test was performed in rats administered CDDP weekly for 4\u00a0weeks. On day 28, the withdrawal latency to thermal stimulation was significantly prolonged in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups. When the von-Frey test was performed to assess mechanical allodynia, the withdrawal threshold was significantly lower in the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups than in the control group on day 6 after the first CDDP dose. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia throughout the experiment with the repeated administration of CDDP, whereas the 17:00-treated group deteriorated from allodynia to hypoalgesia.</p>\n<p>It was revealed that the severe of CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was inhibited in the 5:00-treated group, whereas CDDP-treated groups exhibited mechanical allodynia. These results suggested that the selection of an optimal dosing time ameliorated CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy.</p>\n<p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12885-016-2777-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p>",

CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy exhibits contrary pain reactions, such as allodynia and hypoalgesia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. In the early stage, neuropathy appears as allodynia, which is pain induced by a nonnoxious stimulus, and gradually progresses to hypoalgesia, namely, a decrease or the disappearance of sensations by nonnoxious and noxious stimuli, when CDDP is continuously administered [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. However, it was not reported that an animal model of the CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy matched clinical situation. Then, at the first, we studied to make the model. When CDDP (4\u00a0mg/kg) was given i.v. once weekly, rats showed mechanical allodynia on day 6 after the first administration and prolonged the withdrawal latency by heat stimuli on 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the last dose (Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>). The acute response concerned with the result in mice treated CDDP (2.3\u00a0mg/kg) in the past report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. This observation that the peripheral neuropathy caused by CDDP gradually progressed to hypoalgesia during the continuous administration, mirrors previous work in rats by Han FY et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. It was thought that this change in symptom of peripheral neuropathy may reflect the clinical situation.</p>",

However, it was not reported that an animal model of the CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy matched clinical situation. Then, at the first, we studied to make the model.

In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>].

On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered.

                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>).

However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",

                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

                            "<p>Peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin was previously shown to be ameliorated by chronotherapy in patients with measurable metastases from colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

In the early stage, neuropathy appears as allodynia, which is pain induced by a nonnoxious stimulus, and gradually progresses to hypoalgesia, namely, a decrease or the disappearance of sensations by nonnoxious and noxious stimuli, when CDDP is continuously administered [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. However, it was not reported that an animal model of the CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy matched clinical situation. Then, at the first, we studied to make the model. When CDDP (4\u00a0mg/kg) was given i.v. once weekly, rats showed mechanical allodynia on day 6 after the first administration and prolonged the withdrawal latency by heat stimuli on 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the last dose (Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>). The acute response concerned with the result in mice treated CDDP (2.3\u00a0mg/kg) in the past report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. This observation that the peripheral neuropathy caused by CDDP gradually progressed to hypoalgesia during the continuous administration, mirrors previous work in rats by Han FY et al.

Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>].

On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy exhibits contrary pain reactions, such as allodynia and hypoalgesia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. In the early stage, neuropathy appears as allodynia, which is pain induced by a nonnoxious stimulus, and gradually progresses to hypoalgesia, namely, a decrease or the disappearance of sensations by nonnoxious and noxious stimuli, when CDDP is continuously administered [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. However, it was not reported that an animal model of the CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy matched clinical situation. Then, at the first, we studied to make the model. When CDDP (4\u00a0mg/kg) was given i.v. once weekly, rats showed mechanical allodynia on day 6 after the first administration and prolonged the withdrawal latency by heat stimuli on 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the last dose (Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>). The acute response concerned with the result in mice treated CDDP (2.3\u00a0mg/kg) in the past report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. This observation that the peripheral neuropathy caused by CDDP gradually progressed to hypoalgesia during the continuous administration, mirrors previous work in rats by Han FY et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. It was thought that this change in symptom of peripheral neuropathy may reflect the clinical situation.</p>",
                            "<p>Peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin was previously shown to be ameliorated by chronotherapy in patients with measurable metastases from colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

                            "<p>CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting factor [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Although previous studies have attempted to prevent and decrease peripheral neuropathy, effective treatments have not yet been developed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy exhibits contrary pain reactions, such as allodynia and hypoalgesia [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. In the early stage, neuropathy appears as allodynia, which is pain induced by a nonnoxious stimulus, and gradually progresses to hypoalgesia, namely, a decrease or the disappearance of sensations by nonnoxious and noxious stimuli, when CDDP is continuously administered [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>]. However, it was not reported that an animal model of the CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy matched clinical situation. Then, at the first, we studied to make the model. When CDDP (4\u00a0mg/kg) was given i.v. once weekly, rats showed mechanical allodynia on day 6 after the first administration and prolonged the withdrawal latency by heat stimuli on 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the last dose (Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>). The acute response concerned with the result in mice treated CDDP (2.3\u00a0mg/kg) in the past report [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. This observation that the peripheral neuropathy caused by CDDP gradually progressed to hypoalgesia during the continuous administration, mirrors previous work in rats by Han FY et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. It was thought that this change in symptom of peripheral neuropathy may reflect the clinical situation.</p>",
                            "<p>Peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin was previously shown to be ameliorated by chronotherapy in patients with measurable metastases from colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
                            "<p>In conclusion, pain is an important sign to avoid a variety of risk in life, and hypoalgesia induced by the drug must be avoided. The present study revealed that CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy which proceeded from allodynia to hypoalgesia was inhibited by the administration of CDDP at a specific time. The adverse effects of CDDP, body weights, BUN levels, and peripheral neuropathy may be improved by identical dosing times. Thus, chronotherapy may contribute to ameliorating adverse effects in patients receiving chemotherapy with CDDP.</p>",

Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>].

On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",

                            "<p>Peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin was previously shown to be ameliorated by chronotherapy in patients with measurable metastases from colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",

                            "<p>Peripheral neuropathy induced by oxaliplatin was previously shown to be ameliorated by chronotherapy in patients with measurable metastases from colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]. Moreover, the chronopharmacology of CDDP had shown many evidences in animal and human [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>]. In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00). The dosing time-dependent differences in adverse effects were consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>]. In the present study, the 17:00-treated group showed 73.9\u00a0mg/dL of BUN level on day 19 and 55.8\u00a0g of withdrawal threshold on day 20 when CDDP was weekly given. On the other hands, withdrawal threshold in the 5:00-treated group, in which BUN level showed 82.4\u00a0mg/dL on day 26, was 5.3\u00a0g on day 27. There is no correlation between degree of the nephrotoxicity and the neuropathy. Therefore, we considered that the dosing-time dependency of severity of neuropathy did not necessarily coincide with the CDDP-related toxicities.</p>",
                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered. Animal studies previously demonstrated that CDDP induced mechanical allodynia after its administration, and recovery from mechanical allodynia was observed after discontinuation of the treatment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. These results suggested that the development of severe CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy was delayed or inhibited in the 5:00-treated group. Therefore, the selection of an optimal dosing-time may lead to an effective approach for peripheral neuropathy induced by CDDP.</p>",
                            "<p>A previous study reported that sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) was decreased by CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",

In animal studies, the toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and toxic death were the highest at rest phase in a day. Therefore, we selected the two dosing times (5:00 and 17:00) by referring these reports. In the present study, the group treated with CDDP at rest phase (17:00) showed severe toxicities compared with that at active phase (5:00).

                            "<p>The CDDP-treated groups showed significantly lower withdrawal thresholds than the control group immediately after administration of CDDP. However, mechanical allodynia was temporary in the 5:00-treated group after a single administration and the 17:00-treated group when CDDP was given once weekly. The both dosing groups showed exactly the opposite response against mechanical allodynia by the difference in the number of doses. The reason is thought two possible. The neuropathy was improved by repair factor. Or the rats stopped responding to stimuli by progressing hypoalgesia. After a single administration of CDDP, there were no significant differences to heat stimulation among the all groups on day 24. On the other hand, the withdrawal latency was approximately 2-fold longer in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups on day 28 after the repeated administration. Because the increase in withdrawal latency shows the onset of hypoalgesia, increase in withdrawal thresholds after the single dose may indicate recovery from mechanical allodynia in the 5:00-treated group. In the present study, peripheral neuropathy in the 17:00-treated group progressed from allodynia to hypoalgesia, similar to clinical situations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. The 5:00-treated group maintained allodynia while CDDP was repeatedly administered.

In order to clarify dosing time-dependent differences in the phenotypes of pain responses, the SNCV of the coccygeal nerve was measured 7\u00a0days (day 28) after the fourth administration of CDDP. SNCV was markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than in the control and 5:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM1\" ref-type=\"media\">1</xref>). However, no nerve activity against the electric stimulus was observed in some rats treated with CDDP at 17:00, and thus, SNCV could not be sufficiently calculated. Although it remains unclear whether this result was due to a decline in the conduction velocity because of severe peripheral neuropathy or a technical error, SNCV was markedly decreased in the 17:00-treated group, which showed an increase in the withdrawal latency by the heat stimulation. These responses were observed when the peripheral nerve was injured. We then performed a pathological assessment of the peripheral nerve in the 17:00-treated group 6\u00a0days (day 27) after the fourth administration of CDDP in a preliminary study. No marked difference was noted between the control and 17:00-treated groups (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM2\" ref-type=\"media\">2</xref>). Gilardini A et al. reported that the absence of structural injuries with CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. These findings suggested that peripheral neuropathy was more severe in the 17:00-treated group than in the 5:00-treated group; however, pathological assessments could not clarify dosing time-dependent differences in CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, there was no effective scale to assess histological changes in peripheral nerves such as the sciatic nerve. We intend to investigate genes and proteins related to pain.</p>",
                            "<p>The accumulation of CDDP in the DRGs, which contain the cell bodies of primary afferent sensory neurons and play a role in pain mechanisms, is known to induce CDDP-induced peripheral neuropathy [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>]. A previous study reported that the enhanced accumulation of CDDP in the DRG positively correlated with the severity of peripheral neuropathy in mice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. In the present study, no significant differences were noted in the DRGs levels of CDDP between the 5:00 and 17:00-treated groups. In clinical study, there are few reports of chronopharmacokinetics of CDDP. When CDDP was given at 6:00 or 18:00, the clearance (CL) significantly was higher at 18:00 than at 6:00 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>]. In this study, serum CDDP concentrations were markedly lower in the 17:00-treated group than the 5:00-treated group 60\u2013720\u00a0min after the injection. It was consistent with human and animal that disappearance of CDDP from blood was faster in the active phase than the rest phase. However, the toxicities were inhibited in the 5:00-treated group showed higher the serum level. Therefore, we thought that CDDP pharmacokinetics might not contribute to the dosing time-dependent neuropathy. CDDP shows pharmacological effects by crosslinking DNA. It was reported that platinum level in DNA in kidney showed clear dosing time-dependent difference, and the daily variation contributed to degree of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>]. In this study, platinum concentration in DNA in DRG was not measured because DRG was small tissue. We are studying measurement method of the platinum level in DNA in nerve tissue including DRG to clarify relevance between the dosing time-dependency of neuropathy and the platinum level in DNA.</p>",
                            "<p>Although it is an important to estimate dosing time-dependency of antitumor effect, we have not studied the antitumor effects because LLC-WRC-256 cells, which were breast carcinosarcoma in rat, cannot be transplanted to SD rats. In the preliminary study, the 17:00-treated group (late rest phase) was markedly lower in tumor growth than the control group when CDDP (5\u00a0mg/kg) was i.v. given in ICR nu/nu mice bearing A549 cells, which is human lung cancer (Additional file <xref rid=\"MOESM3\" ref-type=\"media\">3</xref>). Oxaliplatin, which is the third generation platinum anticancer drug, showed high tumor inhibition rate at early active phase compared with late rest phase [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR48\">48</xref>]. Optimal dosing-time of antitumor effects differs by drugs, cancer cell, and engraftment site. Unlike the side effects that target factors are limited, it is difficult to select a uniform dosage timing for target factor is the variety against cancer. Therefore, we think that long-term CDDP therapy can be carried out by decreasing adverse effects using chronotherapy and anti-tumor effect would be directly or indirectly enhanced as a result.</p>",
