Given the limited literature on global education at the graduate level (<xref rid=\"ref13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">Stearns, 2009</xref>), and the investments involved in developing such programs, it is important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these different models. The dedicated Masters programs in global health have the advantage of creating in-depth knowledge of globalization processes and providing specific global health practicum experiences. The drawback is that the graduates are perceived to have more generalist skills when organizations are looking for specific public health expertise. In the \u201csupport\u201d model, students are supported in finding placements overseas and in applying concepts to global health problems in their courses but there are no consistent program requirements. The add-on or collaborative concentration in global health has the advantage of building a generic disciplinary skill set (most commonly epidemiology) that can be applied in a variety of settings, including global ones. The drawback is that the student has enough space in their program for only a few global health courses, leading to a lack of in-depth knowledge in global health.</p>",

Higher proportions of HP students with medium to high prior experience (38% to 55%) from 2006 to 2009 selected two international or global health course electives and 38% of those with high prior experience were satisfied with one elective (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T6\">Table 5</xref>). Given that one-third of the HP students had high prior experience, this information suggests that the students may be focusing their attention on building other skills because they already have a lot of prior GH experience. On the other hand, the proportion of HP students taking three or more international health courses (25% to 33%) was higher in those with low to medium-high prior experience. It makes sense that students with lower experience would want to take more courses but the pattern is not definitive.</p>",

The three options discussed were whether to create a special field or stream focused on global health (dedicated program model), create a collaborative program enabling students in all public health disciplines to gain from exposure to consistent course requirements and an identified cohort of students, or building global health into all courses in all disciplines so that the entire focus of the DLSPH would be on global health as well as each discipline.

De-identified qualitative data were reviewed by the team for key themes and then individual interviews were coded by the Research Assistant (thematic analysis by question). Given that the faculty members were still providing references for alumni and that individuals could be identified by their responses to certain questions, the respondents asked that the qualitative answers be de-linked. Thus, the Research Assistant did all primary coding, and prepared summary files of the qualitative excerpts without identifiers in each thematic category so they could not be linked to the other responses. Numerical data included alumni self-ratings of GH competencies using a 0-10 Likert scale. Quantitative cross-tabulations were prepared by the Research Assistant including prior experiences, GH program components, learning and career outcomes.

However, the alumni follow-up data highlighted the role of student prior experience in their subsequent satisfaction with the concentration.

Most students in the GH concentration admitted from 2006-2009 were classified as having medium to very high levels of prior experience in global health both academically and in terms of work or volunteer experience overseas. There was no clear pattern as to whether those with higher prior experience took more or fewer classes or did more globally-related practica. However, the alumni follow-up data highlighted the role of student prior experience in their subsequent satisfaction with the concentration. Very high prior experience students perhaps had enough global experience and were looking to build discipline-specific skills instead. However, this trend was not significant in the review of program monitoring files. Those dropping the concentration ranged widely in terms of prior experience.</p>",

Unless they are registered in a discipline with a lot of electives, those with low prior experience will not be able to meet the basic competencies in a concentration model.

Given the lack of global health expertise in all faculty, and a strong argument that our strength was our disciplinary training, the collaborative concentration model was selected. Global health training was designed as a secondary emphasis built into the elective space of students\u2019 primary public health program.</p>",
                            "<p>All student applications to the global health concentration from 2006 to 2009 were assessed on prior experience using criteria for length of time volunteering or working in non-Canadian settings, number of international health courses taken as an undergraduate, and interest/understanding of the social determinants of health. Although categorization differed slightly from year to year, admission reviewer ratings of high, medium high, medium, low and very low prior experience levels could be compared across admission years (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">Table 1</xref>). The program monitoring files were also reviewed to extract the number of international health course electives completed and the location of practica for each student, and whether students completed the core course in global public health. The completion of these requirements was examined in relation to prior experience categories and associations with prior experience examined using Fisher\u2019s Exact Test.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, we invited all alumni from the first two GH concentration admissions (2006 and 2007), those who applied to the GH concentration but were not admitted and those who completed requirements or who dropped the GH concentration to be interviewed. Initial contact was by email through a letter from faculty members most involved in the concentration. Ethics approval was received from the Ethics Review Board at the University of Toronto. A Research Assistant contacted alumni by email, telephone, or Facebook up to three times to arrange an interview.</p>",
                            "<p>The semi-structured interview guide aimed to tap experience before entering the masters, aspects of the masters\u2019 experience including each curriculum component and activities since graduation. Telephone interviews with alumni were tape-recorded with permission, consent to participate was obtained before the tape was turned on, the interviews were all conducted in English, and the qualitative sections were transcribed. De-identified qualitative data were reviewed by the team for key themes and then individual interviews were coded by the Research Assistant (thematic analysis by question). Given that the faculty members were still providing references for alumni and that individuals could be identified by their responses to certain questions, the respondents asked that the qualitative answers be de-linked. Thus, the Research Assistant did all primary coding, and prepared summary files of the qualitative excerpts without identifiers in each thematic category so they could not be linked to the other responses. Numerical data included alumni self-ratings of GH competencies using a 0-10 Likert scale. Quantitative cross-tabulations were prepared by the Research Assistant including prior experiences, GH program components, learning and career outcomes. Faculty reviewed the cross-tabulations in Excel looking for patterns. The qualitative answers to the question about alumni opinions about the Concentration Model were thematically analyzed and described in depth in this paper.</p>",

Alumni from the first two cohorts (2006-08 and 2007-09) were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Prior experience was not linked consistently with the number of elective courses, location of practica or completion of requirements. Successful completion of the global health requirements depended more on the student\u2019s base disciplinary program.

Given that one-third of the HP students had high prior experience, this information suggests that the students may be focusing their attention on building other skills because they already have a lot of prior GH experience.

The three options discussed were whether to create a special field or stream focused on global health (dedicated program model), create a collaborative program enabling students in all public health disciplines to gain from exposure to consistent course requirements and an identified cohort of students, or building global health into all courses in all disciplines so that the entire focus of the DLSPH would be on global health as well as each discipline.
