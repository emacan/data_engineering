        "title": "Addressing geographic access barriers to emergency care services: a national ecologic study of hospitals in Brazil",
        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Unequal distribution of emergency care services is a critical barrier to be overcome to assure access to emergency and surgical care. Considering this context it was objective of the present work analyze geographic access barriers to emergency care services in Brazil. A secondary aim of the study is to define possible roles to be assumed by small hospitals in the Brazilian healthcare network to overcome geographic access challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"Par2\">The present work can be classified as a cross-sectional ecological study. To carry out the present study, data of all 5843 Brazilian hospitals were categorized among high complexity centers and small hospitals. The geographical access barriers were identified through the use of two-step floating catchment area method. Once concluded the previous step an evaluation using the Getis-Ord-Gi method was performed to identify spatial clusters of municipalities with limited access to high complexity centers but well covered by well-equipped small hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"Par3\">The analysis of accessibility index of high complexity centers highlighted large portions of the country with nearly zero hospital beds by inhabitant. In contrast, it was possible observe a group of 1595 municipalities with high accessibility to small hospitals, simultaneously with a low coverage of high complexity centers. Among the 1595 municipalities with good accessibility to small hospitals, 74% (1183) were covered by small hospitals with at least 60% of minimum emergency service requirements. The spatial clusters analysis aggregated 589 municipalities with high values related to minimum emergency service requirements. Small hospitals in these 589 cities could promote the equity in access to emergency services benefiting more than eight million people.</p>\n<p id=\"Par4\">There is a spatial disequilibrium within the country with prominent gaps in the health care network for emergency services. Taking this challenge into consideration, small hospitals could be a possible solution and foster equity in access to emergency and surgical care. However more investments in are necessary to improve small hospitals capabilities to fill this gap.</p>",

                            "<p id=\"Par35\">The analysis of emergency care capabilities among municipalities with SH and those covered by HCC enables the identification of access barriers to high complexity services in Brazil. Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par36\">SH often experience challenges with lack of structure, human resources, and work processes, and generally do not have a specific role in regional HCN, resulting in idle capacity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. One can note the lower coverage of SH in the Central-West, rural Northeast, and, markedly, the North region. States such as Amazonas, Amap\u00e1, Par\u00e1 and Roraima contain large segments of territory without emergency specialized services. The conjoint evidences from 2SFCA and spatial cluster analysis pointed out municipalities covered by SH located in these regions presented low values of MESR adherence proportion. In these circumstances, changing the role of SH is not sufficient. It is essential to invest in the implementation of an integrated HCN that takes into account offering the necessary health services to the population covered. Furthermore analysis about desirable features of each SH should be defined by installed healthcare structure, the composition of the workforce, financial profile and role to be assumed inside a HCN. A combined evaluation of these factors could catalyze reforms to offer better structured ECS.</p>"

Up to 2013, the Brazilian healthcare network was composed of 5843 hospitals, 2774 of which were SH and 3069 HCC. Considering the guidelines from Brazilian Ministry of Health, a facility is classified as SH if the number of beds available is equal or less to 50. HCC are defined as institutions with: presence of certification related to ECS and capacity to offer surgical procedures related to ECS, or realized more than 1000 deliveries by month. The HCC were stratified in 2559 exclusive high complexity centers and 486 facilities that were also acting as maternities. From the universe of HCC was made the option to exclude of analysis 24 facilities for been exclusively maternities. These maternities do not act like a complete ECS facility once they do not meet all the criteria defined by Brazilian Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>].

                            "<p id=\"Par35\">The analysis of emergency care capabilities among municipalities with SH and those covered by HCC enables the identification of access barriers to high complexity services in Brazil. Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par36\">SH often experience challenges with lack of structure, human resources, and work processes, and generally do not have a specific role in regional HCN, resulting in idle capacity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. One can note the lower coverage of SH in the Central-West, rural Northeast, and, markedly, the North region. States such as Amazonas, Amap\u00e1, Par\u00e1 and Roraima contain large segments of territory without emergency specialized services. The conjoint evidences from 2SFCA and spatial cluster analysis pointed out municipalities covered by SH located in these regions presented low values of MESR adherence proportion. In these circumstances, changing the role of SH is not sufficient. It is essential to invest in the implementation of an integrated HCN that takes into account offering the necessary health services to the population covered. Furthermore analysis about desirable features of each SH should be defined by installed healthcare structure, the composition of the workforce, financial profile and role to be assumed inside a HCN. A combined evaluation of these factors could catalyze reforms to offer better structured ECS.</p>"

HCC are defined as institutions with: presence of certification related to ECS and capacity to offer surgical procedures related to ECS, or realized more than 1000 deliveries by month. The HCC were stratified in 2559 exclusive high complexity centers and 486 facilities that were also acting as maternities. From the universe of HCC was made the option to exclude of analysis 24 facilities for been exclusively maternities.

Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p>"

Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p>"

Up to 2013, the Brazilian healthcare network was composed of 5843 hospitals, 2774 of which were SH and 3069 HCC. Considering the guidelines from Brazilian Ministry of Health, a facility is classified as SH if the number of beds available is equal or less to 50. HCC are defined as institutions with: presence of certification related to ECS and capacity to offer surgical procedures related to ECS, or realized more than 1000 deliveries by month. The HCC were stratified in 2559 exclusive high complexity centers and 486 facilities that were also acting as maternities. From the universe of HCC was made the option to exclude of analysis 24 facilities for been exclusively maternities. These maternities do not act like a complete ECS facility once they do not meet all the criteria defined by Brazilian Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>].

                            "<p id=\"Par34\">The present work tried to contribute to diminishing the lack of literature approaching the need for the reduction of geographical access barriers to ECS services. Among the objectives of this effort was the analysis of possible roles to be assumed by Brazilian SH to improve ECS access. In Brazil, one study mapped the network of the provision of health services based on the origin and destination of patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The results revealed an extensive network of primary care provision, in which only a few municipalities are disconnected. Yet, approximately half of Brazilian municipalities are disconnected from a network of high complexity services. Most SH are found in low and medium sized municipalities. Facilities classified as SH are recognized to face operational and quality problems, despite their prevalence in Brazil [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. In most cases SH fulfill a role similar to primary care, without the capacity to perform surgeries and admissions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. Thus, populations solely reliant on SH frequently need to travel to municipalities with HCC resulting in geographic access barriers.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par35\">The analysis of emergency care capabilities among municipalities with SH and those covered by HCC enables the identification of access barriers to high complexity services in Brazil. Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par37\">The situation highlighted by hotspot analysis yields new possibilities to reduce geographical access barriers. Hot spot clusters could be considered as alternatives to increase access to high complexity services. Investments to better outfit SH in these regions could improve access to ECS, as the travel time to a emergency service could be shortened. In these regions SH could get a role dedicated to offer more complex care, contributing to better structuring of HCN. This reorientation can contribute to foster equity in access and strengthen Brazilian emergency services system.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par38\">The results demonstrate the distribution of health services in Brazil, based on selected indicators is currently inadequate to meet population needs. Both, the concentration and the role of health facilities in HCN need to be rethought in order to overcome current inequalities in accessing ECS. HCN need to be reorganized in a way that optimizes flows and facilitates efficient processes in economies of scale, without curtailing the population\u2019s access to services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>]. The present research revealed that SH could be a possible solution to improve access to ECS, since they receive investments. Fulfilling needs like: better equipment, adequate human resources and defined roles in HCN can create conditions for health facilities provide ECS for a portion of population that is facing access barriers.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par39\">While overcoming some limitations of previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>], it is worth emphasizing that distances to health facilities located among states borders were not analyzed which is a limitation of the results found. All analyzed distances were confined to the same state, justifiable by the fact that decentralization in health care has led to the development of policy plans that have an intrastate scope in Brazil. Notwithstanding, there is evidence of agreements among states, primarily in the case of border municipalities, which may influence transportation time to access health services.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par41\">This study sought to analyze how the spatial distribution of hospitals in Brazil could influence access to ECS, with a focus on the examination of the geographical access barriers. The results demonstrate spatial disequilibrium within the country, with significant gaps in HCN for emergency care and a large concentration of SH in wealthier regions, suggesting imbalances and inequity in service provision. Due to the implications carried out by the spatial distribution of health services and the growing relevance of health geography in health systems design, the current discussion points for the need to reorganize the distribution and roles of hospital network in Brazil. There were several municipalities located greater than 60\u00a0km from emergency centers highlighting gaps in emergency coverage that could prove useful to inform policy makers. Although such reorganization may face challenges from an economic and political perspective, the present findings underscore how a combined analysis among different services is necessary to consolidate accessibility and quality in health system.</p>",
