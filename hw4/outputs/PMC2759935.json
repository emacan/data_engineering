        "title": "The capacity for multistability in small gene regulatory networks",
        "abstract": "<p>Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of mathematical modeling to gain insight into gene regulatory network behavior across many different organisms. In particular, there has been considerable interest in using mathematical tools to understand how multistable regulatory networks may contribute to developmental processes such as cell fate determination. Indeed, such a network may subserve the formation of unicellular leaf hairs (trichomes) in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>\n<p>In order to investigate the capacity of small gene regulatory networks to generate multiple equilibria, we present a chemical reaction network (CRN)-based modeling formalism and describe a number of methods for CRN analysis in a parameter-free context. These methods are compared and applied to a full set of one-component subnetworks, as well as a large random sample from 40,680 similarly constructed two-component subnetworks. We find that positive feedback and cooperativity mediated by transcription factor (TF) dimerization is a requirement for one-component subnetwork bistability. For subnetworks with two components, the presence of these processes increases the probability that a randomly sampled subnetwork will exhibit multiple equilibria, although we find several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not involve cooperative TF-promoter binding. In the specific case of epidermal differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, dimerization of the GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient for bistability.</p>\n<p>Computational methods utilizing CRN-specific theorems to rule out bistability in small gene regulatory networks are far superior to techniques generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems. Using these methods to conduct an unbiased survey of parameter-free deterministic models of small networks, and the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>epidermal cell differentiation subnetwork in particular, we illustrate how future experimental research may be guided by network structure analysis.</p>",

However, the current release of the CRNT cannot be automated, and is thus difficult to apply to a large set of two-component systems. For this reason we randomly selected 25 two-component subnetworks and applied the INJ and CRNT methods to compare their effectiveness. The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval. Conversely, the INJ method was only able to rule out bistability for 3 of the 19 subnetworks ruled out by the CRNT (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2).

We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4).

We do not use continuation methods to directly rule out saddle-node bifurcations in this work, as our attempts at such analysis have not yielded results, and to our knowledge it would be difficult to explore large numbers of regulatory networks in this fashion. Furthermore, deterministic ODEs are only one of several mathematical structures used to model gene regulatory networks; other possibilities include boolean networks, Petri nets, Markov chains, stochastic ODEs, and so on. Still, the parameter-free approach to modeling that we have emphasized here is an attractive one for at least two reasons: (1) there are often multiple assumptions made (such as the validity of Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type expressions) when complex network models are constructed as a generic system of ODEs, and these assumptions may result in inconsistencies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>], and (2) as we have shown, CRN theory facilitates analysis that is usually more fruitful than techniques available for generic ODEs.</p>",

We find that positive feedback and cooperativity mediated by transcription factor (TF) dimerization is a requirement for one-component subnetwork bistability. For subnetworks with two components, the presence of these processes increases the probability that a randomly sampled subnetwork will exhibit multiple equilibria, although we find several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not involve cooperative TF-promoter binding. In the specific case of epidermal differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, dimerization of the GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient for bistability.</p>",

An important aspect of trichome differentiation not indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> is the free movement of inhibitory proteins to adjacent epidermal cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] where they prevent GL3 from interacting with GL1 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], thus creating a domain of surrounding cells that will not become trichomes and resulting in a characteristic spatial pattern.</p>",

In Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3B</xref> there is also basal production of P from X and degradation of P, however two TFs now associate to form a homodimer (P + P \u21cc PP), and it is this PP dimer that binds to the promoter of X (X + PP \u21cc XPP) and produces P via the dimer-gene complex XPP (XPP \u2192 XPP + P).

As with the monomer-binding model described above, each of these models contains basal expression and degradation of CPC, and GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complex formation. In Model 2, GL3-GL1 can only bind to the promoter of CPC and activate its transcription as a complex dimer (heterotetramer) that forms prior to TF-promoter interaction. Model 3 contains sequential binding of two GL3-GL1 complexes to the separate sites in the CPC promoter, with CPC protein being produced only when both complexes are bound.

We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).

When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4).

We emphasize that the success of the CRNT is partly due to the special form of chemical reaction networks that assume kinetics of the mass-action form. However, this assumption would appear to be a valid one under many working conditions. That the CRNT accurately determined the stability properties of the well-studied positive autoregulatory and reciprocal repression systems (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>, respectively), and that one-component systems found by CRNT to be bistable were confirmed as such with bifurcation diagrams (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Fig. S5), is further validation of the CRNT's usefulness.</p>",

We do not use continuation methods to directly rule out saddle-node bifurcations in this work, as our attempts at such analysis have not yielded results, and to our knowledge it would be difficult to explore large numbers of regulatory networks in this fashion. Furthermore, deterministic ODEs are only one of several mathematical structures used to model gene regulatory networks; other possibilities include boolean networks, Petri nets, Markov chains, stochastic ODEs, and so on. Still, the parameter-free approach to modeling that we have emphasized here is an attractive one for at least two reasons: (1) there are often multiple assumptions made (such as the validity of Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type expressions) when complex network models are constructed as a generic system of ODEs, and these assumptions may result in inconsistencies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>], and (2) as we have shown, CRN theory facilitates analysis that is usually more fruitful than techniques available for generic ODEs.</p>",

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]), a reasonable assumption given that protein dimerization typically provides protection against proteolysis by enhancing thermal stability or through blocking access to monomer degradation tags [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], and (ii) the exclusion of higher-order oligomeric TF complexes (such as trimers or tetramers), an assumption appropriate for many eukaryotic TF gene families where dimerization is sufficient for functionality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. On the other hand, TF activation can occur by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]), a situation analogous to cell signaling pathways in which dual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles confer bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>].

Sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter is plausible, as multiple TF binding sites in gene promoters are a general characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>].

In that case, there are several intriguing possibilities. It may be that one or more of the many additional trichome-related genes that have been recently identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] are as central to trichome differentiation as GL3, GL1, and CPC. It is possible that epidermal cell differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>is not in fact subserved by a bistable gene regulatory network. It may also be that some unknown extrinsic mechanism plays a role in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>epidermal cell fate determination. A mechanism of this kind may render a bistable network irreversible by causing one equilibrium state to be inaccessible [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>], or it may fix a transient activated state before the system can return to a basal equilibrium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>]. There is some evidence for these two latter possibilities, as a differentiated trichome cell is unlikely to revert back to an undifferentiated state. In particular, a recent study has shown that the induction of GL3 function for 4 hrs is sufficient to trigger trichome initiation, with development continuing even after GL3 function is completely removed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. Clearly there are a number of possibilities that we have only begun to investigate. Future experiments will be required to distinguish between them and may yet provide insights into this interesting developmental model system.</p>",

Switch-like behavior is also a characteristic of many developmental processes, and it has been suggested that the maintenance of two distinct phenotypic states in the absence of genetic or environmental differences may sometimes be attributed to bistability in an underlying gene network [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>An intriguing system that exhibits phenotypic bistable behavior, and as such is an excellent candidate for the study of the potential role of bistability in cell fate determination, is the formation of unicellular leaf hairs (trichomes) in the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.

These positive regulators directly regulate other TFs (e.g., GL2) that positively induce trichome initiation, as well as small inhibitory proteins (e.g., CPC). A simplified version of this network is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>. An important aspect of trichome differentiation not indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> is the free movement of inhibitory proteins to adjacent epidermal cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] where they prevent GL3 from interacting with GL1 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], thus creating a domain of surrounding cells that will not become trichomes and resulting in a characteristic spatial pattern.</p>",

GL1 proteins complex with GL3 proteins to directly regulate other transcription factors (e.g., GL2) that positively induce trichome initiation, as well as small inhibitory proteins (e.g., CPC).

Such models assume an underlying mechanism of either the 'activator-inhibitor' or 'trapping/depletion' type, both of which include positive regulation of GL3 by the GL3-GL1 active complex. Consistent with the activator-inhibitor model [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>], it has been shown experimentally that the activators do positively control the diffusible inhibitors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. However, although recent work has suggested that a positive feedback loop may be involved in cell fate specification in the root epidermis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>], no such direct positive feedback has been found in the leaf. Indeed, the regulators of trichome patterning in the leaf may in fact be involved in a negative feedback loop, as recently demonstrated for GL3 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. This poses the question of whether the regulatory subnetworks known to be involved in trichome initiation have the capacity for bistability, or whether this is unlikely given the absence of experimental evidence for direct positive autoregulation.</p>",

Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref> shows that the IG-T, IG-K, and SRG methods give little information about the capacity for multistability in these twelve simple subnetworks.

As shown in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>, partitioning the results according to the number of dimer-binding reactions reveals the importance of TF dimerization and feedback to multistability: the group with no dimers binding has the highest percentage of subnetworks that cannot be bistable (26.2% with confidence interval [19.0%, 34.4%]), and as the number of dimer-binding reactions increases, the percentage of subnetworks definitively without multiple equilibria decreases.

The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval.

As there is no experimental evidence for the direct positive feedback that has been posited in current models of trichome initiation, the question of whether the system can support bistability without it is one of great interest.</p>",
                            "<p>We specify the core trichome differentiation subnetwork as a CRN that contains reaction equations for basal expression and degradation of CPC, formation of the GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complexes, and binding of a single GL3-GL1 complex to the promoter of CPC to positively regulate its production. The constituent equations are given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref> (Model 1). On application of the CRNT, we found that this subnetwork specification cannot support bistability. However, we have shown that details of TF-promoter interactions can be a critical determinant for a regulatory network to exhibit multiple stable equilibria. We thus constructed three additional CRN specifications of the trichome differentiation subnetwork that allow for the possibility of dimerization of the GL3-GL1 active complex. As with the monomer-binding model described above, each of these models contains basal expression and degradation of CPC, and GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complex formation. In Model 2, GL3-GL1 can only bind to the promoter of CPC and activate its transcription as a complex dimer (heterotetramer) that forms prior to TF-promoter interaction. Model 3 contains sequential binding of two GL3-GL1 complexes to the separate sites in the CPC promoter, with CPC protein being produced only when both complexes are bound. Model 4 is a hybrid of Model 1 and Model 2, where the GL3-GL1 can bind to the CPC promoter as a monomer or a dimer, and both can activate transcription of CPC. The constituent equations for these models are also given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. In contrast to the monomer-binding case, we found Models 2-4 are all capable of exhibiting bistability, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation.</p>",
                            "<p>We have used a modeling framework in which small gene regulatory networks are specified as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), with reactions describing transcription factor (TF) production, degradation, dimerization, and association of both monomer and dimer TFs with promoters in a productive or unproductive fashion. We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4). Interestingly, we found several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not include promotor-TF dimer interactions at all (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2), consistent with prior work demonstrating that sequestration and titration of active TFs into inactive complexes can give rise to non-linearity and bistable behavior [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>It is important to note that the analytical methods described herein are not the only ones available for probing the stability properties of a dynamical system. One additional method involves evaluation of the Jacobian matrix (Eq. 2), because the existence of a saddle-node bifurcation leading to stable and unstable equilibria requires the Jacobian to be singular at the critical point <italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ss </italic></sub>(i.e., det{<italic>J</italic>(<italic>c</italic><sub><italic>ss</italic></sub>)} = 0) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>]. We do not use continuation methods to directly rule out saddle-node bifurcations in this work, as our attempts at such analysis have not yielded results, and to our knowledge it would be difficult to explore large numbers of regulatory networks in this fashion. Furthermore, deterministic ODEs are only one of several mathematical structures used to model gene regulatory networks; other possibilities include boolean networks, Petri nets, Markov chains, stochastic ODEs, and so on. Still, the parameter-free approach to modeling that we have emphasized here is an attractive one for at least two reasons: (1) there are often multiple assumptions made (such as the validity of Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type expressions) when complex network models are constructed as a generic system of ODEs, and these assumptions may result in inconsistencies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>], and (2) as we have shown, CRN theory facilitates analysis that is usually more fruitful than techniques available for generic ODEs.</p>",
                            "<p>Although the modeling formalism used here is a simple one, it is not clear that an increase in complexity would lead to different conclusions; for example, we have already demonstrated that excluding mRNA does not influence the one-component subnetwork results. Two other simplifications made find significant experimental support: (i) that TF dimers are stable to proteolytic degradation (cf. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]), a reasonable assumption given that protein dimerization typically provides protection against proteolysis by enhancing thermal stability or through blocking access to monomer degradation tags [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], and (ii) the exclusion of higher-order oligomeric TF complexes (such as trimers or tetramers), an assumption appropriate for many eukaryotic TF gene families where dimerization is sufficient for functionality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. On the other hand, TF activation can occur by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]), a situation analogous to cell signaling pathways in which dual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles confer bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. While it is possible to extend the modeling formalism illustrated here in these and other directions, the additional combinatorial complexity would make surveys of multi-component networks computationally challenging.</p>",
                            "<p>If it can be determined that GL3-GL1 does not in fact dimerize or bind to two separate binding sites in the CPC promoter, and that it is in fact a stable complex, then the current view of the core trichome differentiation network (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) must be incomplete. In that case, there are several intriguing possibilities. It may be that one or more of the many additional trichome-related genes that have been recently identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] are as central to trichome differentiation as GL3, GL1, and CPC. It is possible that epidermal cell differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>is not in fact subserved by a bistable gene regulatory network. It may also be that some unknown extrinsic mechanism plays a role in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>epidermal cell fate determination. A mechanism of this kind may render a bistable network irreversible by causing one equilibrium state to be inaccessible [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>], or it may fix a transient activated state before the system can return to a basal equilibrium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>]. There is some evidence for these two latter possibilities, as a differentiated trichome cell is unlikely to revert back to an undifferentiated state. In particular, a recent study has shown that the induction of GL3 function for 4 hrs is sufficient to trigger trichome initiation, with development continuing even after GL3 function is completely removed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. Clearly there are a number of possibilities that we have only begun to investigate. Future experiments will be required to distinguish between them and may yet provide insights into this interesting developmental model system.</p>",

We find that positive feedback and cooperativity mediated by transcription factor (TF) dimerization is a requirement for one-component subnetwork bistability. For subnetworks with two components, the presence of these processes increases the probability that a randomly sampled subnetwork will exhibit multiple equilibria, although we find several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not involve cooperative TF-promoter binding.

A simplified version of this network is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>. An important aspect of trichome differentiation not indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref> is the free movement of inhibitory proteins to adjacent epidermal cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] where they prevent GL3 from interacting with GL1 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], thus creating a domain of surrounding cells that will not become trichomes and resulting in a characteristic spatial pattern.</p>",

GL1 proteins complex with GL3 proteins to directly regulate other transcription factors (e.g., GL2) that positively induce trichome initiation, as well as small inhibitory proteins (e.g., CPC).

The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval. Conversely, the INJ method was only able to rule out bistability for 3 of the 19 subnetworks ruled out by the CRNT (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2).

The constituent equations are given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref> (Model 1). On application of the CRNT, we found that this subnetwork specification cannot support bistability. However, we have shown that details of TF-promoter interactions can be a critical determinant for a regulatory network to exhibit multiple stable equilibria. We thus constructed three additional CRN specifications of the trichome differentiation subnetwork that allow for the possibility of dimerization of the GL3-GL1 active complex. As with the monomer-binding model described above, each of these models contains basal expression and degradation of CPC, and GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complex formation. In Model 2, GL3-GL1 can only bind to the promoter of CPC and activate its transcription as a complex dimer (heterotetramer) that forms prior to TF-promoter interaction. Model 3 contains sequential binding of two GL3-GL1 complexes to the separate sites in the CPC promoter, with CPC protein being produced only when both complexes are bound. Model 4 is a hybrid of Model 1 and Model 2, where the GL3-GL1 can bind to the CPC promoter as a monomer or a dimer, and both can activate transcription of CPC. The constituent equations for these models are also given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. In contrast to the monomer-binding case, we found Models 2-4 are all capable of exhibiting bistability, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation.</p>",

We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4).

                            "<p>Our application of the various equilibria analysis tools suggests that the interaction graph-based techniques (IG-T and IG-K) that are generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems are rarely informative with respect to small gene regulatory networks. We also found that the deficiency theorems implemented in the Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox (CRNT) are generally more informative than computational (INJ) and graphical (SRG) methods that attempt to rule out multiple equilibria by establishing injectivity of the reaction network polynomial function. We emphasize that the success of the CRNT is partly due to the special form of chemical reaction networks that assume kinetics of the mass-action form. However, this assumption would appear to be a valid one under many working conditions. That the CRNT accurately determined the stability properties of the well-studied positive autoregulatory and reciprocal repression systems (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>, respectively), and that one-component systems found by CRNT to be bistable were confirmed as such with bifurcation diagrams (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Fig. S5), is further validation of the CRNT's usefulness.</p>",

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]), a reasonable assumption given that protein dimerization typically provides protection against proteolysis by enhancing thermal stability or through blocking access to monomer degradation tags [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], and (ii) the exclusion of higher-order oligomeric TF complexes (such as trimers or tetramers), an assumption appropriate for many eukaryotic TF gene families where dimerization is sufficient for functionality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. On the other hand, TF activation can occur by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]), a situation analogous to cell signaling pathways in which dual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles confer bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. While it is possible to extend the modeling formalism illustrated here in these and other directions, the additional combinatorial complexity would make surveys of multi-component networks computationally challenging.</p>",

This capacity of course depends on the specific details of the network architecture. In particular, we found that dimerization of the active GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient to generate a bistable subnetwork, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation. Both of these alternatives have some experimental support. Sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter is plausible, as multiple TF binding sites in gene promoters are a general characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>]. And while dimerization of GL3-GL1 has not been experimentally demonstrated, GL3 can dimerize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>] either through the conserved bHLH domain, as is the case for other bHLH factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>], or through the conserved C-terminal ACT domain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>].

In that case, there are several intriguing possibilities. It may be that one or more of the many additional trichome-related genes that have been recently identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] are as central to trichome differentiation as GL3, GL1, and CPC.

There is some evidence for these two latter possibilities, as a differentiated trichome cell is unlikely to revert back to an undifferentiated state.

While both Eq. 1 and Eq. 3 are nonlinear ODEs, the specific form of CRNs enables the application of powerful CRN-specific network analysis techniques. One computational method can rule out multiple equilibria in a CRN by determining if the associated polynomial function is injective, i.e., it maps distinct arguments to distinct values [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].

Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref> shows that the IG-T, IG-K, and SRG methods give little information about the capacity for multistability in these twelve simple subnetworks.

As shown in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>, partitioning the results according to the number of dimer-binding reactions reveals the importance of TF dimerization and feedback to multistability: the group with no dimers binding has the highest percentage of subnetworks that cannot be bistable (26.2% with confidence interval [19.0%, 34.4%]), and as the number of dimer-binding reactions increases, the percentage of subnetworks definitively without multiple equilibria decreases.

The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval. Conversely, the INJ method was only able to rule out bistability for 3 of the 19 subnetworks ruled out by the CRNT (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2).

                            "<p>We turn our attention to the 'double-negative' feedback system (also known as a reciprocal repression system) first described by Monod and Jacob [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>]: a small network consisting of pair of genes (X<sub>1 </sub>and X<sub>2</sub>) in which each gene's product inhibits transcription of the other gene (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>). It has been shown both theoretically [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] and experimentally [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] that cooperativity in TF binding is required for this subnetwork to exhibit bistable behavior. An analysis of CRN specifications of this small network is thus an excellent test of the techniques discussed herein. We constructed two representatives of this subnetwork: one with regulation via TF monomers (X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>\u21cc X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>for <italic>i </italic>\u2260 <italic>j</italic>) and the other with TF dimerization and regulation via TF dimer-promoter interactions (P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>\u21cc P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>and X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>\u21cc X<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>for <italic>i </italic>\u2260 <italic>j</italic>).

The constituent equations are given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref> (Model 1). On application of the CRNT, we found that this subnetwork specification cannot support bistability. However, we have shown that details of TF-promoter interactions can be a critical determinant for a regulatory network to exhibit multiple stable equilibria. We thus constructed three additional CRN specifications of the trichome differentiation subnetwork that allow for the possibility of dimerization of the GL3-GL1 active complex. As with the monomer-binding model described above, each of these models contains basal expression and degradation of CPC, and GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complex formation. In Model 2, GL3-GL1 can only bind to the promoter of CPC and activate its transcription as a complex dimer (heterotetramer) that forms prior to TF-promoter interaction. Model 3 contains sequential binding of two GL3-GL1 complexes to the separate sites in the CPC promoter, with CPC protein being produced only when both complexes are bound. Model 4 is a hybrid of Model 1 and Model 2, where the GL3-GL1 can bind to the CPC promoter as a monomer or a dimer, and both can activate transcription of CPC. The constituent equations for these models are also given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. In contrast to the monomer-binding case, we found Models 2-4 are all capable of exhibiting bistability, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation.</p>",

We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4). Interestingly, we found several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not include promotor-TF dimer interactions at all (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2), consistent with prior work demonstrating that sequestration and titration of active TFs into inactive complexes can give rise to non-linearity and bistable behavior [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Our application of the various equilibria analysis tools suggests that the interaction graph-based techniques (IG-T and IG-K) that are generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems are rarely informative with respect to small gene regulatory networks.

We emphasize that the success of the CRNT is partly due to the special form of chemical reaction networks that assume kinetics of the mass-action form. However, this assumption would appear to be a valid one under many working conditions. That the CRNT accurately determined the stability properties of the well-studied positive autoregulatory and reciprocal repression systems (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>, respectively), and that one-component systems found by CRNT to be bistable were confirmed as such with bifurcation diagrams (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Fig. S5), is further validation of the CRNT's usefulness.</p>",
                            "<p>It is important to note that the analytical methods described herein are not the only ones available for probing the stability properties of a dynamical system.

We do not use continuation methods to directly rule out saddle-node bifurcations in this work, as our attempts at such analysis have not yielded results, and to our knowledge it would be difficult to explore large numbers of regulatory networks in this fashion. Furthermore, deterministic ODEs are only one of several mathematical structures used to model gene regulatory networks; other possibilities include boolean networks, Petri nets, Markov chains, stochastic ODEs, and so on. Still, the parameter-free approach to modeling that we have emphasized here is an attractive one for at least two reasons: (1) there are often multiple assumptions made (such as the validity of Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type expressions) when complex network models are constructed as a generic system of ODEs, and these assumptions may result in inconsistencies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>], and (2) as we have shown, CRN theory facilitates analysis that is usually more fruitful than techniques available for generic ODEs.</p>",

This capacity of course depends on the specific details of the network architecture. In particular, we found that dimerization of the active GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient to generate a bistable subnetwork, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation. Both of these alternatives have some experimental support. Sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter is plausible, as multiple TF binding sites in gene promoters are a general characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>]. And while dimerization of GL3-GL1 has not been experimentally demonstrated, GL3 can dimerize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>] either through the conserved bHLH domain, as is the case for other bHLH factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>], or through the conserved C-terminal ACT domain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>].

In that case, there are several intriguing possibilities. It may be that one or more of the many additional trichome-related genes that have been recently identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] are as central to trichome differentiation as GL3, GL1, and CPC. It is possible that epidermal cell differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>is not in fact subserved by a bistable gene regulatory network.

There is some evidence for these two latter possibilities, as a differentiated trichome cell is unlikely to revert back to an undifferentiated state. In particular, a recent study has shown that the induction of GL3 function for 4 hrs is sufficient to trigger trichome initiation, with development continuing even after GL3 function is completely removed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>].

Thus, the absence of any positive circuits in a network rules out the capacity for bistability, regardless of the parameters chosen for the model. Another necessary condition for multistationarity proposed by Kaufman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>] concerns the <italic>nuclei </italic>of the interaction graph, which are defined as unions of one or more disjoint circuits involving all the vertices of the interaction graph. Multistationarity requires either (i) the presence of a variable nucleus (that is, a nucleus with at least one edge displaying more than one sign depending on species concentration), or (ii) the presence of two nuclei of opposite signs, where the sign of a nucleus with <italic>p </italic>positive circuits is (-1)<sup><italic>p</italic>+1 </sup>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>].

In Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3B</xref> there is also basal production of P from X and degradation of P, however two TFs now associate to form a homodimer (P + P \u21cc PP), and it is this PP dimer that binds to the promoter of X (X + PP \u21cc XPP) and produces P via the dimer-gene complex XPP (XPP \u2192 XPP + P). From these sets of elementary reactions, which following ref. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>] can also be visualized as wiring diagrams (see second row of Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>), one can write an unambiguous system of ODEs that take the form of a CRN (Eq. 3). Although it has been shown that transcription and elements of post-transcriptional control combine to regulate the protein production rate, and that stochasticity exists at all levels of regulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>], for simplicity we model protein production as a single deterministic process (cf.

While it has been previously demonstrated through analysis of a positive autoregulatory motif model with explicit mRNA concentration that dimerization is necessary for bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], it is significant that modeling transcription and translation as a single operation leads to similar results.</p>",

However, the current release of the CRNT cannot be automated, and is thus difficult to apply to a large set of two-component systems. For this reason we randomly selected 25 two-component subnetworks and applied the INJ and CRNT methods to compare their effectiveness. The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval. Conversely, the INJ method was only able to rule out bistability for 3 of the 19 subnetworks ruled out by the CRNT (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2).

It has been shown both theoretically [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] and experimentally [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] that cooperativity in TF binding is required for this subnetwork to exhibit bistable behavior. An analysis of CRN specifications of this small network is thus an excellent test of the techniques discussed herein.

                            "<p>We have used a modeling framework in which small gene regulatory networks are specified as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), with reactions describing transcription factor (TF) production, degradation, dimerization, and association of both monomer and dimer TFs with promoters in a productive or unproductive fashion. We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4).

                            "<p>Our application of the various equilibria analysis tools suggests that the interaction graph-based techniques (IG-T and IG-K) that are generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems are rarely informative with respect to small gene regulatory networks. We also found that the deficiency theorems implemented in the Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox (CRNT) are generally more informative than computational (INJ) and graphical (SRG) methods that attempt to rule out multiple equilibria by establishing injectivity of the reaction network polynomial function. We emphasize that the success of the CRNT is partly due to the special form of chemical reaction networks that assume kinetics of the mass-action form. However, this assumption would appear to be a valid one under many working conditions. That the CRNT accurately determined the stability properties of the well-studied positive autoregulatory and reciprocal repression systems (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>, respectively), and that one-component systems found by CRNT to be bistable were confirmed as such with bifurcation diagrams (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Fig. S5), is further validation of the CRNT's usefulness.</p>",
                            "<p>It is important to note that the analytical methods described herein are not the only ones available for probing the stability properties of a dynamical system.

We do not use continuation methods to directly rule out saddle-node bifurcations in this work, as our attempts at such analysis have not yielded results, and to our knowledge it would be difficult to explore large numbers of regulatory networks in this fashion. Furthermore, deterministic ODEs are only one of several mathematical structures used to model gene regulatory networks; other possibilities include boolean networks, Petri nets, Markov chains, stochastic ODEs, and so on. Still, the parameter-free approach to modeling that we have emphasized here is an attractive one for at least two reasons: (1) there are often multiple assumptions made (such as the validity of Michaelis-Menten or Hill-type expressions) when complex network models are constructed as a generic system of ODEs, and these assumptions may result in inconsistencies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>], and (2) as we have shown, CRN theory facilitates analysis that is usually more fruitful than techniques available for generic ODEs.</p>",

                            "<p>Although the modeling formalism used here is a simple one, it is not clear that an increase in complexity would lead to different conclusions; for example, we have already demonstrated that excluding mRNA does not influence the one-component subnetwork results. Two other simplifications made find significant experimental support: (i) that TF dimers are stable to proteolytic degradation (cf. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]), a reasonable assumption given that protein dimerization typically provides protection against proteolysis by enhancing thermal stability or through blocking access to monomer degradation tags [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], and (ii) the exclusion of higher-order oligomeric TF complexes (such as trimers or tetramers), an assumption appropriate for many eukaryotic TF gene families where dimerization is sufficient for functionality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. On the other hand, TF activation can occur by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]), a situation analogous to cell signaling pathways in which dual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles confer bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>].

In particular, we found that dimerization of the active GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient to generate a bistable subnetwork, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation. Both of these alternatives have some experimental support. Sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter is plausible, as multiple TF binding sites in gene promoters are a general characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>]. And while dimerization of GL3-GL1 has not been experimentally demonstrated, GL3 can dimerize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>] either through the conserved bHLH domain, as is the case for other bHLH factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>], or through the conserved C-terminal ACT domain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>].

However, the current release of the CRNT cannot be automated, and is thus difficult to apply to a large set of two-component systems. For this reason we randomly selected 25 two-component subnetworks and applied the INJ and CRNT methods to compare their effectiveness. The CRNT found 19 subnetworks that do not support multiple equilibria (76% with confidence interval [52%, 88%]), and it generated parameter sets that lead to bistability for 5 of the remaining 6 subnetworks (20% of total with confidence interval [4%, 36%]). This is quite similar to the fraction of one-component subnetworks that were found by the CRNT to be bistable (25%) and well within the confidence interval. Conversely, the INJ method was only able to rule out bistability for 3 of the 19 subnetworks ruled out by the CRNT (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2).

It has been shown both theoretically [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>] and experimentally [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>] that cooperativity in TF binding is required for this subnetwork to exhibit bistable behavior. An analysis of CRN specifications of this small network is thus an excellent test of the techniques discussed herein. We constructed two representatives of this subnetwork: one with regulation via TF monomers (X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>\u21cc X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>for <italic>i </italic>\u2260 <italic>j</italic>) and the other with TF dimerization and regulation via TF dimer-promoter interactions (P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>\u21cc P<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>P<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>and X<sub><italic>i </italic></sub>+ P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>\u21cc X<sub><italic>i</italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>P<sub><italic>j </italic></sub>for <italic>i </italic>\u2260 <italic>j</italic>).

CRNT analysis confirmed that the subnetwork containing TF dimerization exhibits bistability for a suitable set of parameters, while the subnetwork with double-negative feedback via TF monomers does not have this capacity.</p>",
                            "<p>We have used a modeling framework in which small gene regulatory networks are specified as chemical reaction networks (CRNs), with reactions describing transcription factor (TF) production, degradation, dimerization, and association of both monomer and dimer TFs with promoters in a productive or unproductive fashion. We used these methods to survey twelve subnetworks consisting of one TF gene and gene product (the one-component subnetworks) and found that bistability is only exhibited by those that include positive feedback with cooperative TF binding (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>). This is not unexpected, as direct positive feedback and non-linearity are often prerequisites for bistability in simple systems [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. When the analysis tools were applied to a large random sample of two-component subnetworks (from a total of 40,680 consistent with our CRN specification rules; see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>), we found that the presence of cooperative TF binding makes it more difficult to rule out bistability (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>), although it is ruled out more often in subnetworks lacking direct positive feedback than it is for those lacking direct negative feedback (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Tables S3 and S4). Interestingly, we found several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not include promotor-TF dimer interactions at all (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F5\">5</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Table S2), consistent with prior work demonstrating that sequestration and titration of active TFs into inactive complexes can give rise to non-linearity and bistable behavior [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Our application of the various equilibria analysis tools suggests that the interaction graph-based techniques (IG-T and IG-K) that are generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems are rarely informative with respect to small gene regulatory networks. We also found that the deficiency theorems implemented in the Chemical Reaction Network Toolbox (CRNT) are generally more informative than computational (INJ) and graphical (SRG) methods that attempt to rule out multiple equilibria by establishing injectivity of the reaction network polynomial function. We emphasize that the success of the CRNT is partly due to the special form of chemical reaction networks that assume kinetics of the mass-action form. However, this assumption would appear to be a valid one under many working conditions. That the CRNT accurately determined the stability properties of the well-studied positive autoregulatory and reciprocal repression systems (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>, respectively), and that one-component systems found by CRNT to be bistable were confirmed as such with bifurcation diagrams (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F4\">4</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>, Fig. S5), is further validation of the CRNT's usefulness.</p>",
                            "<p>The current state of CRN-based modeling and analysis does not include stochastic effects, despite the fact that there is both experimental and theoretical evidence that low concentrations of TFs or binding sites can lead to fluctuations (i.e, noise) that may sometimes be an essential aspect of network function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>]. The CRN approach thus represents a first step towards generating mixed models of biological systems that incorporate stochastic effects. Future work could extend CRN-based techniques to include stochastic dynamics consistent with the elementary processes that compose gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>]. We further anticipate that new releases of the CRNT software package will also be amenable to automation and will allow for CRNs of unlimited size.</p>",
                            "<p>Although the modeling formalism used here is a simple one, it is not clear that an increase in complexity would lead to different conclusions; for example, we have already demonstrated that excluding mRNA does not influence the one-component subnetwork results. Two other simplifications made find significant experimental support: (i) that TF dimers are stable to proteolytic degradation (cf. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]), a reasonable assumption given that protein dimerization typically provides protection against proteolysis by enhancing thermal stability or through blocking access to monomer degradation tags [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>], and (ii) the exclusion of higher-order oligomeric TF complexes (such as trimers or tetramers), an assumption appropriate for many eukaryotic TF gene families where dimerization is sufficient for functionality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. On the other hand, TF activation can occur by posttranslational modification (e.g., phosphorylation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]), a situation analogous to cell signaling pathways in which dual phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles confer bistability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>]. While it is possible to extend the modeling formalism illustrated here in these and other directions, the additional combinatorial complexity would make surveys of multi-component networks computationally challenging.</p>",
                            "<p>Applying the CRNT to the real-world example of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>epidermal cell differentiation, we have shown that gene regulatory subnetworks consistent with established components and interactions may have the capacity for bistability. This capacity of course depends on the specific details of the network architecture. In particular, we found that dimerization of the active GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient to generate a bistable subnetwork, even in the absence of direct positive autoregulation. Both of these alternatives have some experimental support. Sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter is plausible, as multiple TF binding sites in gene promoters are a general characteristic of eukaryotic gene expression [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>]. And while dimerization of GL3-GL1 has not been experimentally demonstrated, GL3 can dimerize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>] either through the conserved bHLH domain, as is the case for other bHLH factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B66\">66</xref>], or through the conserved C-terminal ACT domain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>].

                            "<p>If it can be determined that GL3-GL1 does not in fact dimerize or bind to two separate binding sites in the CPC promoter, and that it is in fact a stable complex, then the current view of the core trichome differentiation network (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) must be incomplete. In that case, there are several intriguing possibilities. It may be that one or more of the many additional trichome-related genes that have been recently identified [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>] are as central to trichome differentiation as GL3, GL1, and CPC. It is possible that epidermal cell differentiation in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>is not in fact subserved by a bistable gene regulatory network. It may also be that some unknown extrinsic mechanism plays a role in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>epidermal cell fate determination. A mechanism of this kind may render a bistable network irreversible by causing one equilibrium state to be inaccessible [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>], or it may fix a transient activated state before the system can return to a basal equilibrium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>]. There is some evidence for these two latter possibilities, as a differentiated trichome cell is unlikely to revert back to an undifferentiated state. In particular, a recent study has shown that the induction of GL3 function for 4 hrs is sufficient to trigger trichome initiation, with development continuing even after GL3 function is completely removed [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. Clearly there are a number of possibilities that we have only begun to investigate. Future experiments will be required to distinguish between them and may yet provide insights into this interesting developmental model system.</p>",

The heterodimers P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2 </sub>and P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1 </sub>were assumed to be equivalent.

The constituent equations are given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref> (Model 1). On application of the CRNT, we found that this subnetwork specification cannot support bistability. However, we have shown that details of TF-promoter interactions can be a critical determinant for a regulatory network to exhibit multiple stable equilibria. We thus constructed three additional CRN specifications of the trichome differentiation subnetwork that allow for the possibility of dimerization of the GL3-GL1 active complex. As with the monomer-binding model described above, each of these models contains basal expression and degradation of CPC, and GL3-GL1 and GL3-CPC complex formation. In Model 2, GL3-GL1 can only bind to the promoter of CPC and activate its transcription as a complex dimer (heterotetramer) that forms prior to TF-promoter interaction. Model 3 contains sequential binding of two GL3-GL1 complexes to the separate sites in the CPC promoter, with CPC protein being produced only when both complexes are bound. Model 4 is a hybrid of Model 1 and Model 2, where the GL3-GL1 can bind to the CPC promoter as a monomer or a dimer, and both can activate transcription of CPC. The constituent equations for these models are also given in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>.

For (A), the motif can be specified as a CRN that includes basal production of P from X (X \u2192 X + P), degradation of P (P \u2192 \u2205), binding and dissociation of P from the promoter of X (X + P \u21cc XP), and production of P by the transcription factor-gene complex XP (XP \u2192 XP + P). For (B), there is also basal production of P from X and degradation of P, however two transcription factors now associate to form a homodimer (P + P \u21cc PP), and it is this PP dimer that binds to the promoter of X (X + PP \u21cc XPP) and produces P via the dimer-gene complex XPP (XPP \u2192 XPP + P). In both cases the motif can also be visualized as wiring diagrams. The corresponding interaction graphs contain positive interactions (blue), negative interactions (red), and a variable interaction that can be either positive or negative, depending on the concentration of the transcription factor P (black).
