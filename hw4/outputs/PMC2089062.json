        "title": "Pesticide exposure, risk factors and health problems among cutflower farmers: a cross sectional study",
        "abstract": "<p>This was a cross-sectional study which aimed to determine associations between hematologic indices such as red blood cell cholinesterase (RBC) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), with illnesses related to pesticide exposure among cutflower farmers in La Trinidad, Benguet. One hundred two (102) randomly selected cutflower farmers underwent comprehensive, personal physical health and laboratory examinations and answered a questionnaire on work practices and illness. Majority were males (52%) and most belonged to the 20\u201335 age group (45%). Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48%), easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Analysis showed that RBC cholinesterase levels were positively associated with age (p = 0.02), and selling pesticide containers (p = 0.008). number of years of using pesticides (p = 0.022), use of contaminated cloth (p = 0.033), incorrect mixing of pesticides (p = 0.041), sex (p = 0.002) and illness due to pesticides (p = 0.005) were correlated with abnormal MCV. Significant associations were also found for hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count. Predictors of RBC cholinesterase were years of pesticide use (p = 0.037) and abnormalities on health (p = 0.029). The findings of the study can be used for information dissemination and pesticide reduction programs for the cutflower farmers.</p>",

This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>"

Other factors that may result in false cholinesterase levels are collection, shipping and laboratory errors, and poor record keeping and organization (Boiko, Keifer, Furman, Weyrauch, Hanks, 2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p>",

Other predictors are number of hours of pesticide exposure (p = 0.025), sex (p = 0.040) and RBC count (= 0.039). Women usually have lower MCVs than men because they regularly shed blood due to menstruation. Meanwhile, MCV is an index of RBC count, therefore a lower RBC count would result in lower MCVs. Since we have already accounted for possible normal physiological explanations for these results, it seems that pesticide exposure, in particular the length of exposure, is a highly significant predictor of MCV levels. Similar studies, like that of Casale, Scott, Anderson, JR., Vitzthum, Gold, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>], have found that pesticide use is a significant predictor of RBC count and hematocrit and that extensive use of pesticides significantly reduces serum complement activity.</p>",

Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48%), easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Analysis showed that RBC cholinesterase levels were positively associated with age (p = 0.02), and selling pesticide containers (p = 0.008). number of years of using pesticides (p = 0.022), use of contaminated cloth (p = 0.033), incorrect mixing of pesticides (p = 0.041), sex (p = 0.002) and illness due to pesticides (p = 0.005) were correlated with abnormal MCV.

Health symptoms included in the survey were non-specific such as drowsiness, and may be attributed to a number of conditions. This makes the detection of pesticide exposure/poisoning very difficult since no distinctive or specific symptom is predictive of the event. Further elucidation of clinical manifestations that may be used as predictors of pesticide exposure must be conducted for early and easy detection of possible poisoning.

Pesticide related health problems usually manifest as a series of symptoms depending on severity of exposure. For instance, mild organophosphate poisoning manifests in the form of malaise, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, loose stools, sweating, abdominal pain and salivation. Moderate poisoning includes dyspnea, decreased muscular strength, bronchospasm, miosis, muscle fasciculation, tremor, motor incoordination, bradycardia, and hypotension/hypertension. Severe manifestation could result in coma, respiratory paralysis, extreme hypersecretion, cyanosis, sustained hypotension, extreme muscle weakness, muscular paralysis and convulsion (Iowa State University, 1995)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Other illnesses associated with pesticide exposure are dermatitis, asthma exacerbation (Sanborn, Cole, Abelsohn, Weir, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], sensory peripheral nerve defects, chronic neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction (Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2002;, Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], deficits in verbal abstraction, attention, and memory (Farahat, Abdelrasoul, Amr, Shebl, 2003)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and anxiety and depression (Jamal, Hansen, Pilkington, Buchanan, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>].

Biological marker such as monitoring of serum cholinesterase and cholinesterase enzymes in red blood cells (RBC) can assess actual exposure to pesticides particularly organophosphates (Tayser, 2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. Organophosphates inhibit the action cholinesterase thus increasing the cholinergic effects of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine in the body and depolarization of neural transmission (Weiss, Amler S, Amler R, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].

Of 380 reported pregnancies, 20 (5.26%) were preterm while 6.3% were abortions. Two cases of congenital anomalies were also found (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). It has also been found that infertility is more common in women involved in agriculture and those who live in farms (Fuortes, Clark, Kirchner, Smith, 1997) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. The study of Beam in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] reported that babies born to women with high levels of pesticides in their blood are lighter than babies who had not been exposed to the chemicals. In China's rural Anhui province (Raloff, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was indicated that at DDT concentrations present in young women there, the pesticide can affect both menstrual cycles and can cause miscarriages in the first few weeks of pregnancy.</p>",

Tamaron is a category II pesticide containing the organophosphate Methamidophos and Diethylene glycol, while Lannate is a category Ib pesticide whose active ingredient is Methomyl. A study done locally by Baurdoux, Snelder, De Snoo, in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] also found prevalent use of and easy access to pesticides classified by the WHO as highly or moderately hazardous and some pesticides tagged for restricted use by Environmental Protection Agency among farmers in the Cagayan Valley.</p>",

Twenty percent (20%) of the farmers used pesticides for more than 20 years and almost 15% have used it for 11\u201320 years. This is very significant, and indicates chronic exposure among these farmers. The farmers were exposed to 30 minutes to 4 hours per day every application, with an average of 3 hours. They are exposed about 1 to 4 days a week or an average of one and a half days in the application of pesticide.</p>",
                            "<p>The activities performed by the farmers while working with pesticides were loading, applying, and mixing (76.4%, 77.4% and 76.4% respectively). During these activities, they are exposed for more than 12 times a year, which is quite considerable. Incorrect work practices were also noted among farmers such as re-entering recently sprayed area (79.3%), wiping sweat off the face (66.8%), spraying against the wind (23.1), spills at the back (45.2%) and while spraying (51.9%), loading (29.8%) and mixing (35.1).</p>",
                            "<p>Despite the high risk and frequency of exposure, farmers did not wear proper personal protection while working with pesticides. Boots were the only protective equipment worn by majority of the farmers, and practically no one used aprons or gauntlet gloves. Cloth face masks which do not offer adequate coverage for some chemicals were used by a number of respondents (41%). Improvise forms of PPE were also used such as handkerchiefs, long sleeves and plastic pants.</p>",
                            "<p>Re-entering a recently sprayed area has been the cause of a poisoning outbreak in Poland in 2002 after applicators re-entered a contaminated area before the required safety period has lapsed. In the same country, 22 poisoning cases were seen as a result of spraying without adequate protective gear (Przybylska, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. This shows the seriousness of the situation faced by the farmers. When it comes to disposal of pesticide containers, majority (32.4%) said that they stored used containers in their backyard. This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",

Specifically, headache was the most frequently reported symptom (48%) closely followed by easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Blurring of vision and palpitations were also common (36.3% and 33.3% respectively). Similar symptoms were found by Strong, Thompson, Coronado, Griffith, Vigoren, Islas, in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] among farmers exposed to organophosphates.</p>",

Moderate poisoning includes dyspnea, decreased muscular strength, bronchospasm, miosis, muscle fasciculation, tremor, motor incoordination, bradycardia, and hypotension/hypertension. Severe manifestation could result in coma, respiratory paralysis, extreme hypersecretion, cyanosis, sustained hypotension, extreme muscle weakness, muscular paralysis and convulsion (Iowa State University, 1995)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].

This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",

Other predictors are number of hours of pesticide exposure (p = 0.025), sex (p = 0.040) and RBC count (= 0.039). Women usually have lower MCVs than men because they regularly shed blood due to menstruation. Meanwhile, MCV is an index of RBC count, therefore a lower RBC count would result in lower MCVs. Since we have already accounted for possible normal physiological explanations for these results, it seems that pesticide exposure, in particular the length of exposure, is a highly significant predictor of MCV levels. Similar studies, like that of Casale, Scott, Anderson, JR., Vitzthum, Gold, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>], have found that pesticide use is a significant predictor of RBC count and hematocrit and that extensive use of pesticides significantly reduces serum complement activity.</p>",

Health symptoms included in the survey were non-specific such as drowsiness, and may be attributed to a number of conditions. This makes the detection of pesticide exposure/poisoning very difficult since no distinctive or specific symptom is predictive of the event. Further elucidation of clinical manifestations that may be used as predictors of pesticide exposure must be conducted for early and easy detection of possible poisoning. Moreover, differentiation must be made between acute and chronic exposures.</p>",

                            "<p>Pesticide use has been documented to lead to adverse health effects. Pesticide related health problems usually manifest as a series of symptoms depending on severity of exposure. For instance, mild organophosphate poisoning manifests in the form of malaise, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, loose stools, sweating, abdominal pain and salivation. Moderate poisoning includes dyspnea, decreased muscular strength, bronchospasm, miosis, muscle fasciculation, tremor, motor incoordination, bradycardia, and hypotension/hypertension. Severe manifestation could result in coma, respiratory paralysis, extreme hypersecretion, cyanosis, sustained hypotension, extreme muscle weakness, muscular paralysis and convulsion (Iowa State University, 1995)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Other illnesses associated with pesticide exposure are dermatitis, asthma exacerbation (Sanborn, Cole, Abelsohn, Weir, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], sensory peripheral nerve defects, chronic neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction (Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2002;, Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], deficits in verbal abstraction, attention, and memory (Farahat, Abdelrasoul, Amr, Shebl, 2003)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and anxiety and depression (Jamal, Hansen, Pilkington, Buchanan, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>].

Twenty percent (20%) of the farmers used pesticides for more than 20 years and almost 15% have used it for 11\u201320 years. This is very significant, and indicates chronic exposure among these farmers. The farmers were exposed to 30 minutes to 4 hours per day every application, with an average of 3 hours. They are exposed about 1 to 4 days a week or an average of one and a half days in the application of pesticide.</p>",
                            "<p>The activities performed by the farmers while working with pesticides were loading, applying, and mixing (76.4%, 77.4% and 76.4% respectively).

Incorrect work practices were also noted among farmers such as re-entering recently sprayed area (79.3%), wiping sweat off the face (66.8%), spraying against the wind (23.1), spills at the back (45.2%) and while spraying (51.9%), loading (29.8%) and mixing (35.1).</p>",
                            "<p>Re-entering a recently sprayed area has been the cause of a poisoning outbreak in Poland in 2002 after applicators re-entered a contaminated area before the required safety period has lapsed. In the same country, 22 poisoning cases were seen as a result of spraying without adequate protective gear (Przybylska, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. This shows the seriousness of the situation faced by the farmers. When it comes to disposal of pesticide containers, majority (32.4%) said that they stored used containers in their backyard. This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>Pesticides have been associated with a number of diseases, and even death. This was seen by Fleming, Gomez-Martin, Zheng, Ma, Lee, et al. in 2003 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], who studied mortality linked 1986\u20131994 National Health Interview Survey data. They found that farmers and pesticide applicators were at greater risk of accidental mortality compared to all other workers. Furthermore, both male and female workers had a higher risk of cancers of the nervous, lymphatic and hematopoietic systems. Among infants, Young, Eskenazi, Gladstone, Bradman, Pedersen, Johnson, Barr, Furlong, Holland, (2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>] documented a significant association between <italic>in utero </italic>organophosphate exposure and abnormal reflexes, which may be associated with subsequent impairment of neuropsychological functioning. Lander and Ronne (1995) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>] also found significant odds ratio for leukemia among farmers. These point out the role of pesticides in carcinogenesis and disruption of hematopoiesis. Genotoxicity has also been linked to pesticides (Undeger &amp; Basaran, 2005; Varona, Cardenas, Crane, Rocha, Cuervo, Vargas, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p>",

The activity of cholinesterase enzymes in the blood can be utilized as a biomarker for the effect of organophosphates. An exposed person will show abnormally low levels of activity of cholinesterase enzymes measured in the serum or in red blood cells (as RBC cholinesterase). The latter is more closely correlated with cholinesterase activity in the nervous system (Tinoco-Ojanguren &amp; Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>It should be noted, however, that RBC cholinesterase is more difficult to measure and is depressed more slowly than plasma cholinesterase.

Cholinesterase levels are also affected by inter- and intra-individual variability (Tinoco-Ojanguren and Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Therefore, pre-exposure baseline levels should be established for each individual so that meaningful changes in cholinesterase levels may be detected (Hernandez, Gomez, Pena, Gil, Rodrigo, Villanueva, Pla, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, certain conditions other than pesticide exposure can lower plasma and RBC cholinesterase levels, confounding interpretation of test results. The former can be decreased by liver disease, malnutrition, alcoholism, nephritic syndrome, early pregnancy, contraceptive pills, and metoclopramide. Meanwhile, RBC cholinesterase levels are lowered by hemolytic and pernicious anemia, recovery from hemorrhage, and reticulocytosis. Other factors that may result in false cholinesterase levels are collection, shipping and laboratory errors, and poor record keeping and organization (Boiko, Keifer, Furman, Weyrauch, Hanks, 2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].</p>",

Far more serious and long-term consequences have been seen in humans by Khristeva and Mirchev in 1993 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>].

Women usually have lower MCVs than men because they regularly shed blood due to menstruation. Meanwhile, MCV is an index of RBC count, therefore a lower RBC count would result in lower MCVs. Since we have already accounted for possible normal physiological explanations for these results, it seems that pesticide exposure, in particular the length of exposure, is a highly significant predictor of MCV levels. Similar studies, like that of Casale, Scott, Anderson, JR., Vitzthum, Gold, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>], have found that pesticide use is a significant predictor of RBC count and hematocrit and that extensive use of pesticides significantly reduces serum complement activity.</p>",
                            "<p>As for RBC cholinesterase (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T7\">7</xref>), the significant predictors are, again, years of pesticide use (p = 0.037) and health symptoms reported in the survey (p = 0.029). the number of years using pesticides gives an index of the length and possible extent of exposure, which has been shown to lower RBC cholinesterase levels. Health symptoms included in the survey were non-specific such as drowsiness, and may be attributed to a number of conditions. This makes the detection of pesticide exposure/poisoning very difficult since no distinctive or specific symptom is predictive of the event. Further elucidation of clinical manifestations that may be used as predictors of pesticide exposure must be conducted for early and easy detection of possible poisoning. Moreover, differentiation must be made between acute and chronic exposures.</p>",
                            "<p>The study has demonstrated the detrimental effect of pesticide exposure on RBC cholinesterase levels and the association of various hematologic indices with risk factors and measures of pesticide exposure.

One hundred two (102) randomly selected cutflower farmers underwent comprehensive, personal physical health and laboratory examinations and answered a questionnaire on work practices and illness. Majority were males (52%) and most belonged to the 20\u201335 age group (45%). Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48%), easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%).

                            "<p>Pesticide use has been documented to lead to adverse health effects. Pesticide related health problems usually manifest as a series of symptoms depending on severity of exposure. For instance, mild organophosphate poisoning manifests in the form of malaise, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, loose stools, sweating, abdominal pain and salivation. Moderate poisoning includes dyspnea, decreased muscular strength, bronchospasm, miosis, muscle fasciculation, tremor, motor incoordination, bradycardia, and hypotension/hypertension. Severe manifestation could result in coma, respiratory paralysis, extreme hypersecretion, cyanosis, sustained hypotension, extreme muscle weakness, muscular paralysis and convulsion (Iowa State University, 1995)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. Other illnesses associated with pesticide exposure are dermatitis, asthma exacerbation (Sanborn, Cole, Abelsohn, Weir, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], sensory peripheral nerve defects, chronic neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction (Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2002;, Miranda, McConnell, Delgado, Cuadra, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], deficits in verbal abstraction, attention, and memory (Farahat, Abdelrasoul, Amr, Shebl, 2003)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], and anxiety and depression (Jamal, Hansen, Pilkington, Buchanan, 2002)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. These effects have been suggested to impair farmers' ability to comply with established safety procedures (Beseler and Stallones, 2003)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>].</p>",

Of 380 reported pregnancies, 20 (5.26%) were preterm while 6.3% were abortions. Two cases of congenital anomalies were also found (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). It has also been found that infertility is more common in women involved in agriculture and those who live in farms (Fuortes, Clark, Kirchner, Smith, 1997) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. The study of Beam in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] reported that babies born to women with high levels of pesticides in their blood are lighter than babies who had not been exposed to the chemicals. In China's rural Anhui province (Raloff, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], it was indicated that at DDT concentrations present in young women there, the pesticide can affect both menstrual cycles and can cause miscarriages in the first few weeks of pregnancy.</p>",

                            "<p>Certain behaviors and practices were identified to predisposed to pesticide exposure and illness. Twenty percent (20%) of the farmers used pesticides for more than 20 years and almost 15% have used it for 11\u201320 years. This is very significant, and indicates chronic exposure among these farmers. The farmers were exposed to 30 minutes to 4 hours per day every application, with an average of 3 hours. They are exposed about 1 to 4 days a week or an average of one and a half days in the application of pesticide.</p>",
                            "<p>The activities performed by the farmers while working with pesticides were loading, applying, and mixing (76.4%, 77.4% and 76.4% respectively). During these activities, they are exposed for more than 12 times a year, which is quite considerable. Incorrect work practices were also noted among farmers such as re-entering recently sprayed area (79.3%), wiping sweat off the face (66.8%), spraying against the wind (23.1), spills at the back (45.2%) and while spraying (51.9%), loading (29.8%) and mixing (35.1).</p>",
                            "<p>Despite the high risk and frequency of exposure, farmers did not wear proper personal protection while working with pesticides. Boots were the only protective equipment worn by majority of the farmers, and practically no one used aprons or gauntlet gloves. Cloth face masks which do not offer adequate coverage for some chemicals were used by a number of respondents (41%). Improvise forms of PPE were also used such as handkerchiefs, long sleeves and plastic pants.</p>",
                            "<p>Re-entering a recently sprayed area has been the cause of a poisoning outbreak in Poland in 2002 after applicators re-entered a contaminated area before the required safety period has lapsed. In the same country, 22 poisoning cases were seen as a result of spraying without adequate protective gear (Przybylska, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. This shows the seriousness of the situation faced by the farmers. When it comes to disposal of pesticide containers, majority (32.4%) said that they stored used containers in their backyard. This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>A number of respondents (23.5%) reported being ill due to pesticide use during the last 12 months, with 2.9% having constant illness, 3.9% having frequent illness and 16.7% exhibiting occasional symptoms.

                            "<p>Pesticides have been associated with a number of diseases, and even death. This was seen by Fleming, Gomez-Martin, Zheng, Ma, Lee, et al. in 2003 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], who studied mortality linked 1986\u20131994 National Health Interview Survey data. They found that farmers and pesticide applicators were at greater risk of accidental mortality compared to all other workers. Furthermore, both male and female workers had a higher risk of cancers of the nervous, lymphatic and hematopoietic systems. Among infants, Young, Eskenazi, Gladstone, Bradman, Pedersen, Johnson, Barr, Furlong, Holland, (2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>] documented a significant association between <italic>in utero </italic>organophosphate exposure and abnormal reflexes, which may be associated with subsequent impairment of neuropsychological functioning. Lander and Ronne (1995) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>] also found significant odds ratio for leukemia among farmers. These point out the role of pesticides in carcinogenesis and disruption of hematopoiesis. Genotoxicity has also been linked to pesticides (Undeger &amp; Basaran, 2005; Varona, Cardenas, Crane, Rocha, Cuervo, Vargas, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p>",

Specifically, headache was the most frequently reported symptom (48%) closely followed by easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Blurring of vision and palpitations were also common (36.3% and 33.3% respectively).

The activity of cholinesterase enzymes in the blood can be utilized as a biomarker for the effect of organophosphates. An exposed person will show abnormally low levels of activity of cholinesterase enzymes measured in the serum or in red blood cells (as RBC cholinesterase). The latter is more closely correlated with cholinesterase activity in the nervous system (Tinoco-Ojanguren &amp; Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p>",

Cholinesterase levels are also affected by inter- and intra-individual variability (Tinoco-Ojanguren and Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Therefore, pre-exposure baseline levels should be established for each individual so that meaningful changes in cholinesterase levels may be detected (Hernandez, Gomez, Pena, Gil, Rodrigo, Villanueva, Pla, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",

A study done locally by Baurdoux, Snelder, De Snoo, in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] also found prevalent use of and easy access to pesticides classified by the WHO as highly or moderately hazardous and some pesticides tagged for restricted use by Environmental Protection Agency among farmers in the Cagayan Valley.</p>",
                            "<p>Certain behaviors and practices were identified to predisposed to pesticide exposure and illness. Twenty percent (20%) of the farmers used pesticides for more than 20 years and almost 15% have used it for 11\u201320 years. This is very significant, and indicates chronic exposure among these farmers. The farmers were exposed to 30 minutes to 4 hours per day every application, with an average of 3 hours. They are exposed about 1 to 4 days a week or an average of one and a half days in the application of pesticide.</p>",
                            "<p>The activities performed by the farmers while working with pesticides were loading, applying, and mixing (76.4%, 77.4% and 76.4% respectively). During these activities, they are exposed for more than 12 times a year, which is quite considerable. Incorrect work practices were also noted among farmers such as re-entering recently sprayed area (79.3%), wiping sweat off the face (66.8%), spraying against the wind (23.1), spills at the back (45.2%) and while spraying (51.9%), loading (29.8%) and mixing (35.1).</p>",
                            "<p>Despite the high risk and frequency of exposure, farmers did not wear proper personal protection while working with pesticides. Boots were the only protective equipment worn by majority of the farmers, and practically no one used aprons or gauntlet gloves. Cloth face masks which do not offer adequate coverage for some chemicals were used by a number of respondents (41%). Improvise forms of PPE were also used such as handkerchiefs, long sleeves and plastic pants.</p>",
                            "<p>Re-entering a recently sprayed area has been the cause of a poisoning outbreak in Poland in 2002 after applicators re-entered a contaminated area before the required safety period has lapsed. In the same country, 22 poisoning cases were seen as a result of spraying without adequate protective gear (Przybylska, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. This shows the seriousness of the situation faced by the farmers. When it comes to disposal of pesticide containers, majority (32.4%) said that they stored used containers in their backyard. This is a dangerous practice since household members may mistake it for another container and reuse it. Other previously identified risk behaviors for exposure included frequent pesticide use, washing pesticides equipment in water sources used by humans, inadequate disposal of empty pesticide containers, and eating and drinking during pesticide application (Hurtig, San Sebastian, Soto, Shingre, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Pesticides have been associated with a number of diseases, and even death. This was seen by Fleming, Gomez-Martin, Zheng, Ma, Lee, et al. in 2003 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], who studied mortality linked 1986\u20131994 National Health Interview Survey data. They found that farmers and pesticide applicators were at greater risk of accidental mortality compared to all other workers. Furthermore, both male and female workers had a higher risk of cancers of the nervous, lymphatic and hematopoietic systems. Among infants, Young, Eskenazi, Gladstone, Bradman, Pedersen, Johnson, Barr, Furlong, Holland, (2005) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>] documented a significant association between <italic>in utero </italic>organophosphate exposure and abnormal reflexes, which may be associated with subsequent impairment of neuropsychological functioning. Lander and Ronne (1995) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>] also found significant odds ratio for leukemia among farmers. These point out the role of pesticides in carcinogenesis and disruption of hematopoiesis. Genotoxicity has also been linked to pesticides (Undeger &amp; Basaran, 2005; Varona, Cardenas, Crane, Rocha, Cuervo, Vargas, 2003) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].</p>",

HEENT symptoms (blurring of vision, deafness, headache) were also predominant among the farmers. Involvement of the skin was also noted, with 21% of farmers having integumentary abnormalities. Specifically, headache was the most frequently reported symptom (48%) closely followed by easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Blurring of vision and palpitations were also common (36.3% and 33.3% respectively). Similar symptoms were found by Strong, Thompson, Coronado, Griffith, Vigoren, Islas, in 2004 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>] among farmers exposed to organophosphates.</p>",
                            "<p>On physical examination, 90 or 88.2% of those examined were found to have abnormal peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Eighty two percent had abnormal temperature, followed by abnormal health findings (e.g. cardiorespiratory distress). Forty one percent were also found to have elevated blood pressures (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T3\">3</xref>). Such a constellation of symptoms are consistent with previous findings of increased likelihood of chronic disability, health conditions, and poor health among pesticide applicators (NPCIS, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Cholinesterase actually corresponds to two enzymes \u2013 acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase (also called plasma cholinesterase) (Hernandez, Gomez, Pena, Gil, Rodrigo, Villanueva, Pla, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>]. The activity of cholinesterase enzymes in the blood can be utilized as a biomarker for the effect of organophosphates. An exposed person will show abnormally low levels of activity of cholinesterase enzymes measured in the serum or in red blood cells (as RBC cholinesterase). The latter is more closely correlated with cholinesterase activity in the nervous system (Tinoco-Ojanguren &amp; Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p>",

Tinoco-Ojanguren and Halperin in 1998 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] also found similar lowering of cholinesterase values among agricultural peasants. Ceratin hematological parameters wee also abnormal, namely hemoglobin, hematocrit, and eosinophil count. These laboratory findings are similar to those found by Svoboda [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>] in 2001. The liver (ASL and LAT) and kidney function test (creatinine) were all normal for the respondents (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Cholinesterase measurements also have limitations, since the rate of enzyme inhibition and subsequent recovery may differ with exposure to varying organophosphates. Cholinesterase levels are also affected by inter- and intra-individual variability (Tinoco-Ojanguren and Halperin, 1998) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Therefore, pre-exposure baseline levels should be established for each individual so that meaningful changes in cholinesterase levels may be detected (Hernandez, Gomez, Pena, Gil, Rodrigo, Villanueva, Pla, 2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Many other hematologic changes secondary to acute and chronic pesticide exposure have been documented in both humans and animals, although there are some conflicting results (Meaklim, Yang, Drummer, Killalea, Staikos, Horomidis, Rutherford, Ioannides-Demos, Lim, McLean, McNeil, 2003; Saly, Kacmar, Neuschl, Jantosoovic, 1995) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].

In rats, Fujitani, Tada, Yoneyama, (2004) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>] found that sub-chronic exposure to chlopropham induced dose-dependent, although reversible methemoglobinemia, anemia, splenomegaly and pathological lesions indicating hemolytic anemia.

Far more serious and long-term consequences have been seen in humans by Khristeva and Mirchev in 1993 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>].

Since we have already accounted for possible normal physiological explanations for these results, it seems that pesticide exposure, in particular the length of exposure, is a highly significant predictor of MCV levels. Similar studies, like that of Casale, Scott, Anderson, JR., Vitzthum, Gold, [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>], have found that pesticide use is a significant predictor of RBC count and hematocrit and that extensive use of pesticides significantly reduces serum complement activity.</p>",

One hundred two (102) randomly selected cutflower farmers underwent comprehensive, personal physical health and laboratory examinations and answered a questionnaire on work practices and illness. Majority were males (52%) and most belonged to the 20\u201335 age group (45%). Majority of exposed farmers were symptomatic, with most common complaints being headache (48%), easy fatigability (46.1%) and cough (40.2%). Analysis showed that RBC cholinesterase levels were positively associated with age (p = 0.02), and selling pesticide containers (p = 0.008). number of years of using pesticides (p = 0.022), use of contaminated cloth (p = 0.033), incorrect mixing of pesticides (p = 0.041), sex (p = 0.002) and illness due to pesticides (p = 0.005) were correlated with abnormal MCV. Significant associations were also found for hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count. Predictors of RBC cholinesterase were years of pesticide use (p = 0.037) and abnormalities on health (p = 0.029). The findings of the study can be used for information dissemination and pesticide reduction programs for the cutflower farmers.</p>",
