        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is an online portal operated by Amazon where \u2018requesters\u2019 (individuals or businesses) can submit jobs for \u2018workers.\u2019 MTurk is used extensively by academics as a quick and cheap means of collecting questionnaire data, including information on alcohol consumption, from a diverse sample of participants. We tested the feasibility of recruiting for alcohol Internet intervention trials through MTurk.</p>\n<p id=\"Par2\">Participants, 18\u00a0years or older, who drank at least weekly were recruited for four intervention trials (combined sample size, <italic>N</italic>\u2009=\u200911,107). The same basic recruitment strategy was employed for each trial \u2013 invite participants to complete a survey about alcohol consumption (less than 15\u00a0min in length, US$1.50 payment), identify eligible participants who drank in a hazardous fashion, invite those eligible to complete a follow-up survey ($10 payment), randomize participants to be sent or not sent information to access an online intervention for hazardous alcohol use. Procedures where put in place to optimize the chances that participants could only complete the baseline survey once.</p>\n<p id=\"Par3\">There was a substantially slower rate of recruitment by the fourth trial compared to the earlier trials. Demographic characteristics also varied across trials (age, sex, employment and marital status). Patterns of alcohol consumption, while displaying some differences, did not appear to vary in a linear fashion between trials.</p>\n<p id=\"Par4\">It is possible to recruit large (but not inexhaustible) numbers of people who drink in a hazardous fashion. Issues for online intervention research when employing this sample are discussed.</p>",

The same basic recruitment strategy was employed for each trial \u2013 invite participants to complete a survey about alcohol consumption (less than 15\u00a0min in length, US$1.50 payment), identify eligible participants who drank in a hazardous fashion, invite those eligible to complete a follow-up survey ($10 payment), randomize participants to be sent or not sent information to access an online intervention for hazardous alcohol use. Procedures where put in place to optimize the chances that participants could only complete the baseline survey once.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par7\">Recruiting participants can be challenging, whether for longitudinal studies, single occasion surveys, or for intervention trials. Many researchers have turned to online advertisement as a means of speeding up participant recruitment. This method of recruitment is particularly useful when the research itself can be conducted online, without requiring face-to-face interaction with the participant. Such online recruitment methods have included use of online newspapers advertisements, Google AdWords, and Facebook, each of which have their respective costs, and vary in the speed with which participants are recruited [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"Par8\">Another version of online recruitment is via services such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk; <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.mturk.com\">www.MTurk.com</ext-link>). MTurk is an online platform where more than half of a million people (primarily restricted to the USA) have signed up as \u2018workers.\u2019 These participants then access a list of jobs (including surveys) that they can complete for pay (transferred through the MTurk portal). Individuals, businesses, or researchers who post jobs for completion, referred to as \u2018requesters,\u2019 are only privy to each worker\u2019s MTurk ID number, and with the survey being conducted on a server completely separated from the MTurk portal (i.e., Amazon cannot access the data collected by the researcher), it allows for a situation of near anonymity for the recruited participants. It is this anonymity, along with the potential to find another means of recruiting large numbers of participants quickly and at low cost, that makes MTurk potentially attractive for online intervention trials. The MTurk portal has already been used for many online research studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. However, few of these studies have employed longitudinal designs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>] and there appears to be limited research employing MTurk participants in intervention trials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par17\">We have conducted recruitment for four online intervention trials targeting hazardous alcohol consumption using the MTurk platform (Trial 1: September 2016; Trial 2: December 2016; Trial 3: January 2017; Trial 4: March 2017). The first two stages for all recruitments were the same. An advertisement was placed on the MTurk platform for \u2018workers\u2019 to complete a task (called a \u2018HIT\u2019 \u2013 Human Intelligence Task; in this case to complete a survey), \u201cThe Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is conducting a survey on people\u2019s drinking. Only people who currently drink alcohol are asked to participate.\u201d The workers were told that the survey would take less than 15\u00a0min to complete and that the payment was $1.50 (an amount in line with other surveys advertised on MTurk; note that Amazon charges an extra 40% on top of this payment for use of the MTurk platform). Workers who clicked on the link were taken to a brief description of the study (a survey on people\u2019s drinking) and were asked to complete a screener to determine eligibility (must be 18\u00a0years or older, report drinking once per week or more often); the study description and brief eligibility screener (along with the rest of the trial materials) were located on a separate survey that was independent of the MTurk portal. Those who were eligible were sent to an online consent form that described the purpose of the study (people\u2019s experiences with drinking). This consent form mentioned that some participants would be asked if they would like to take part in another server but that we did not know if they would be asked as of yet (setting up for the recruitment of eligible participants for the intervention trials). Those who agreed to participate were then sent to the online baseline survey.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par19\">When conducting multiple studies from the same account, the MTurk platform allows the requestor (the customer hiring the workers) to assign workers who have completed a HIT a code (a \u2018qualification\u2019; specific to one requestor\u2019s account). This then allows requestors to restrict subsequently posted HITs to workers who have not been assigned a code; thus preventing workers who do not meet screener criteria from reattempting the survey during another day of recruitment as they are prevented from seeing the HIT advertisement again. The same process can be used to ensure that workers only take part in one of multiple trials. As can be seen on Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>, which lists the data cleaning steps for the baseline surveys on all four trials, the assignment of qualifications is not a perfect solution. For example, qualifications cannot be assigned to workers who complete the survey, but do not submit the HIT, or to workers who only partially complete a survey. However, post-hoc data cleaning allows the researcher to ensure that each worker is only included once in the set of studies (assuming that the same participant does not have several MTurk ID numbers \u2013 this is hard to accomplish as Amazon collects the workers\u2019 Social Security Number on registration).<table-wrap id=\"Tab1\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Final baseline survey sample size calculation</p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th /><th>Trial 1</th><th>Trial 2</th><th>Trial 3</th><th>Trial 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Duration of trial recruitment</td><td>3.2\u00a0h</td><td>7\u00a0days</td><td>9\u00a0days</td><td>32\u00a0days</td></tr><tr><td>Total # (<italic>N</italic>) of surveys accessed</td><td>1252</td><td>4943</td><td>5412</td><td>5846</td></tr><tr><td>Total # of surveys removed % (of <italic>N</italic>)</td><td>30.0 (381)</td><td>34.4 (1699)</td><td>36.1 (1956)</td><td>39.5 (2310)</td></tr><tr><td># (<italic>n</italic>) Reasons for removal [% of <italic>n</italic>]</td><td>381</td><td>1699</td><td>1956</td><td>2310</td></tr><tr><td>Blank surveys</td><td>1.0% (1)</td><td>1.9% (33)</td><td>1.9% (38)</td><td>1.5% (34)</td></tr><tr><td>Duplicates and suspicious data <sup>a</sup>\n</td><td>9.2% (35)</td><td>11.8% (200)</td><td>3.6% (71)</td><td>9.5% (220)</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete eligible screeners</td><td>8.9% (34)</td><td>2.8% (47)</td><td>4.1% (81)</td><td>5.4% (125)</td></tr><tr><td>Ineligible screeners <sup>b</sup>\n</td><td>50.7% (193)</td><td>54.3% (923)</td><td>65.6% (1284)</td><td>58.8% (1359)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants did not pass all attention checks</td><td>27.8% (106)</td><td>27.4% (466)</td><td>22.1% (432)</td><td>21.0% (485)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants who indicated they did not respond honestly</td><td>2.4% (9)</td><td>1.8% (30)</td><td>2.6% (50)</td><td>3.8% (87)</td></tr><tr><td>Final baseline survey sample size</td><td>871</td><td>3244</td><td>3456</td><td>3536</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>\n<sup>a</sup> Participants who accessed the survey multiple times, but only submitted one complete survey were retained once in the final sample.

Procedures where put in place to optimize the chances that participants could only complete the baseline survey once.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par7\">Recruiting participants can be challenging, whether for longitudinal studies, single occasion surveys, or for intervention trials. Many researchers have turned to online advertisement as a means of speeding up participant recruitment. This method of recruitment is particularly useful when the research itself can be conducted online, without requiring face-to-face interaction with the participant. Such online recruitment methods have included use of online newspapers advertisements, Google AdWords, and Facebook, each of which have their respective costs, and vary in the speed with which participants are recruited [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"Par8\">Another version of online recruitment is via services such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk; <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.mturk.com\">www.MTurk.com</ext-link>). MTurk is an online platform where more than half of a million people (primarily restricted to the USA) have signed up as \u2018workers.\u2019 These participants then access a list of jobs (including surveys) that they can complete for pay (transferred through the MTurk portal). Individuals, businesses, or researchers who post jobs for completion, referred to as \u2018requesters,\u2019 are only privy to each worker\u2019s MTurk ID number, and with the survey being conducted on a server completely separated from the MTurk portal (i.e., Amazon cannot access the data collected by the researcher), it allows for a situation of near anonymity for the recruited participants. It is this anonymity, along with the potential to find another means of recruiting large numbers of participants quickly and at low cost, that makes MTurk potentially attractive for online intervention trials. The MTurk portal has already been used for many online research studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. However, few of these studies have employed longitudinal designs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>] and there appears to be limited research employing MTurk participants in intervention trials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par17\">We have conducted recruitment for four online intervention trials targeting hazardous alcohol consumption using the MTurk platform (Trial 1: September 2016; Trial 2: December 2016; Trial 3: January 2017; Trial 4: March 2017). The first two stages for all recruitments were the same. An advertisement was placed on the MTurk platform for \u2018workers\u2019 to complete a task (called a \u2018HIT\u2019 \u2013 Human Intelligence Task; in this case to complete a survey), \u201cThe Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is conducting a survey on people\u2019s drinking. Only people who currently drink alcohol are asked to participate.\u201d The workers were told that the survey would take less than 15\u00a0min to complete and that the payment was $1.50 (an amount in line with other surveys advertised on MTurk; note that Amazon charges an extra 40% on top of this payment for use of the MTurk platform). Workers who clicked on the link were taken to a brief description of the study (a survey on people\u2019s drinking) and were asked to complete a screener to determine eligibility (must be 18\u00a0years or older, report drinking once per week or more often); the study description and brief eligibility screener (along with the rest of the trial materials) were located on a separate survey that was independent of the MTurk portal. Those who were eligible were sent to an online consent form that described the purpose of the study (people\u2019s experiences with drinking). This consent form mentioned that some participants would be asked if they would like to take part in another server but that we did not know if they would be asked as of yet (setting up for the recruitment of eligible participants for the intervention trials). Those who agreed to participate were then sent to the online baseline survey.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par19\">When conducting multiple studies from the same account, the MTurk platform allows the requestor (the customer hiring the workers) to assign workers who have completed a HIT a code (a \u2018qualification\u2019; specific to one requestor\u2019s account). This then allows requestors to restrict subsequently posted HITs to workers who have not been assigned a code; thus preventing workers who do not meet screener criteria from reattempting the survey during another day of recruitment as they are prevented from seeing the HIT advertisement again. The same process can be used to ensure that workers only take part in one of multiple trials. As can be seen on Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>, which lists the data cleaning steps for the baseline surveys on all four trials, the assignment of qualifications is not a perfect solution. For example, qualifications cannot be assigned to workers who complete the survey, but do not submit the HIT, or to workers who only partially complete a survey. However, post-hoc data cleaning allows the researcher to ensure that each worker is only included once in the set of studies (assuming that the same participant does not have several MTurk ID numbers \u2013 this is hard to accomplish as Amazon collects the workers\u2019 Social Security Number on registration).<table-wrap id=\"Tab1\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Final baseline survey sample size calculation</p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th /><th>Trial 1</th><th>Trial 2</th><th>Trial 3</th><th>Trial 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Duration of trial recruitment</td><td>3.2\u00a0h</td><td>7\u00a0days</td><td>9\u00a0days</td><td>32\u00a0days</td></tr><tr><td>Total # (<italic>N</italic>) of surveys accessed</td><td>1252</td><td>4943</td><td>5412</td><td>5846</td></tr><tr><td>Total # of surveys removed % (of <italic>N</italic>)</td><td>30.0 (381)</td><td>34.4 (1699)</td><td>36.1 (1956)</td><td>39.5 (2310)</td></tr><tr><td># (<italic>n</italic>) Reasons for removal [% of <italic>n</italic>]</td><td>381</td><td>1699</td><td>1956</td><td>2310</td></tr><tr><td>Blank surveys</td><td>1.0% (1)</td><td>1.9% (33)</td><td>1.9% (38)</td><td>1.5% (34)</td></tr><tr><td>Duplicates and suspicious data <sup>a</sup>\n</td><td>9.2% (35)</td><td>11.8% (200)</td><td>3.6% (71)</td><td>9.5% (220)</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete eligible screeners</td><td>8.9% (34)</td><td>2.8% (47)</td><td>4.1% (81)</td><td>5.4% (125)</td></tr><tr><td>Ineligible screeners <sup>b</sup>\n</td><td>50.7% (193)</td><td>54.3% (923)</td><td>65.6% (1284)</td><td>58.8% (1359)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants did not pass all attention checks</td><td>27.8% (106)</td><td>27.4% (466)</td><td>22.1% (432)</td><td>21.0% (485)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants who indicated they did not respond honestly</td><td>2.4% (9)</td><td>1.8% (30)</td><td>2.6% (50)</td><td>3.8% (87)</td></tr><tr><td>Final baseline survey sample size</td><td>871</td><td>3244</td><td>3456</td><td>3536</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>\n<sup>a</sup> Participants who accessed the survey multiple times, but only submitted one complete survey were retained once in the final sample.

The same basic recruitment strategy was employed for each trial \u2013 invite participants to complete a survey about alcohol consumption (less than 15\u00a0min in length, US$1.50 payment), identify eligible participants who drank in a hazardous fashion, invite those eligible to complete a follow-up survey ($10 payment), randomize participants to be sent or not sent information to access an online intervention for hazardous alcohol use. Procedures where put in place to optimize the chances that participants could only complete the baseline survey once.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par7\">Recruiting participants can be challenging, whether for longitudinal studies, single occasion surveys, or for intervention trials. Many researchers have turned to online advertisement as a means of speeding up participant recruitment. This method of recruitment is particularly useful when the research itself can be conducted online, without requiring face-to-face interaction with the participant. Such online recruitment methods have included use of online newspapers advertisements, Google AdWords, and Facebook, each of which have their respective costs, and vary in the speed with which participants are recruited [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p xmlns:ns0=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" id=\"Par8\">Another version of online recruitment is via services such as Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk; <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"http://www.mturk.com\">www.MTurk.com</ext-link>). MTurk is an online platform where more than half of a million people (primarily restricted to the USA) have signed up as \u2018workers.\u2019 These participants then access a list of jobs (including surveys) that they can complete for pay (transferred through the MTurk portal). Individuals, businesses, or researchers who post jobs for completion, referred to as \u2018requesters,\u2019 are only privy to each worker\u2019s MTurk ID number, and with the survey being conducted on a server completely separated from the MTurk portal (i.e., Amazon cannot access the data collected by the researcher), it allows for a situation of near anonymity for the recruited participants. It is this anonymity, along with the potential to find another means of recruiting large numbers of participants quickly and at low cost, that makes MTurk potentially attractive for online intervention trials. The MTurk portal has already been used for many online research studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. However, few of these studies have employed longitudinal designs [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>] and there appears to be limited research employing MTurk participants in intervention trials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par17\">We have conducted recruitment for four online intervention trials targeting hazardous alcohol consumption using the MTurk platform (Trial 1: September 2016; Trial 2: December 2016; Trial 3: January 2017; Trial 4: March 2017). The first two stages for all recruitments were the same. An advertisement was placed on the MTurk platform for \u2018workers\u2019 to complete a task (called a \u2018HIT\u2019 \u2013 Human Intelligence Task; in this case to complete a survey), \u201cThe Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is conducting a survey on people\u2019s drinking. Only people who currently drink alcohol are asked to participate.\u201d The workers were told that the survey would take less than 15\u00a0min to complete and that the payment was $1.50 (an amount in line with other surveys advertised on MTurk; note that Amazon charges an extra 40% on top of this payment for use of the MTurk platform). Workers who clicked on the link were taken to a brief description of the study (a survey on people\u2019s drinking) and were asked to complete a screener to determine eligibility (must be 18\u00a0years or older, report drinking once per week or more often); the study description and brief eligibility screener (along with the rest of the trial materials) were located on a separate survey that was independent of the MTurk portal. Those who were eligible were sent to an online consent form that described the purpose of the study (people\u2019s experiences with drinking). This consent form mentioned that some participants would be asked if they would like to take part in another server but that we did not know if they would be asked as of yet (setting up for the recruitment of eligible participants for the intervention trials). Those who agreed to participate were then sent to the online baseline survey.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par19\">When conducting multiple studies from the same account, the MTurk platform allows the requestor (the customer hiring the workers) to assign workers who have completed a HIT a code (a \u2018qualification\u2019; specific to one requestor\u2019s account). This then allows requestors to restrict subsequently posted HITs to workers who have not been assigned a code; thus preventing workers who do not meet screener criteria from reattempting the survey during another day of recruitment as they are prevented from seeing the HIT advertisement again. The same process can be used to ensure that workers only take part in one of multiple trials. As can be seen on Table\u00a0<xref rid=\"Tab1\" ref-type=\"table\">1</xref>, which lists the data cleaning steps for the baseline surveys on all four trials, the assignment of qualifications is not a perfect solution. For example, qualifications cannot be assigned to workers who complete the survey, but do not submit the HIT, or to workers who only partially complete a survey. However, post-hoc data cleaning allows the researcher to ensure that each worker is only included once in the set of studies (assuming that the same participant does not have several MTurk ID numbers \u2013 this is hard to accomplish as Amazon collects the workers\u2019 Social Security Number on registration).<table-wrap id=\"Tab1\"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Final baseline survey sample size calculation</p></caption><table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th /><th>Trial 1</th><th>Trial 2</th><th>Trial 3</th><th>Trial 4</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Duration of trial recruitment</td><td>3.2\u00a0h</td><td>7\u00a0days</td><td>9\u00a0days</td><td>32\u00a0days</td></tr><tr><td>Total # (<italic>N</italic>) of surveys accessed</td><td>1252</td><td>4943</td><td>5412</td><td>5846</td></tr><tr><td>Total # of surveys removed % (of <italic>N</italic>)</td><td>30.0 (381)</td><td>34.4 (1699)</td><td>36.1 (1956)</td><td>39.5 (2310)</td></tr><tr><td># (<italic>n</italic>) Reasons for removal [% of <italic>n</italic>]</td><td>381</td><td>1699</td><td>1956</td><td>2310</td></tr><tr><td>Blank surveys</td><td>1.0% (1)</td><td>1.9% (33)</td><td>1.9% (38)</td><td>1.5% (34)</td></tr><tr><td>Duplicates and suspicious data <sup>a</sup>\n</td><td>9.2% (35)</td><td>11.8% (200)</td><td>3.6% (71)</td><td>9.5% (220)</td></tr><tr><td>Incomplete eligible screeners</td><td>8.9% (34)</td><td>2.8% (47)</td><td>4.1% (81)</td><td>5.4% (125)</td></tr><tr><td>Ineligible screeners <sup>b</sup>\n</td><td>50.7% (193)</td><td>54.3% (923)</td><td>65.6% (1284)</td><td>58.8% (1359)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants did not pass all attention checks</td><td>27.8% (106)</td><td>27.4% (466)</td><td>22.1% (432)</td><td>21.0% (485)</td></tr><tr><td>Participants who indicated they did not respond honestly</td><td>2.4% (9)</td><td>1.8% (30)</td><td>2.6% (50)</td><td>3.8% (87)</td></tr><tr><td>Final baseline survey sample size</td><td>871</td><td>3244</td><td>3456</td><td>3536</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>\n<sup>a</sup> Participants who accessed the survey multiple times, but only submitted one complete survey were retained once in the final sample.
