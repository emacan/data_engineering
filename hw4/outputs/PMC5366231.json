These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, we wanted to investigate potential correlation of our results with clinical data; therefore impact of presence of studied polymorphisms on progression of stage of tumor was tested, by a correlation of the distribution of genotypes with the state of tumor by the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",
                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                        "text": "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

Results are presented in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>; only pairs that modulate the risk at a statistically significant level are shown. For the full set of results showing all pairs of gene-gene interactions, please refer to the tables in Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3840243\">https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3840243</ext-link>. It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",
                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>].

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",
                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis.

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk.

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>].

Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence.

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts.

The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms.

Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, we wanted to investigate potential correlation of our results with clinical data; therefore impact of presence of studied polymorphisms on progression of stage of tumor was tested, by a correlation of the distribution of genotypes with the state of tumor by the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification. Results are presented in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>. We found that 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene are increasing the risk of cancer in the second degree of advancement in relation to the first degree.</p>",
                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

For the full set of results showing all pairs of gene-gene interactions, please refer to the tables in Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" ns0:href=\"https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3840243\">https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/3840243</ext-link>. It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",
                            "<p>In addition, we wanted to investigate potential correlation of our results with clinical data; therefore impact of presence of studied polymorphisms on progression of stage of tumor was tested, by a correlation of the distribution of genotypes with the state of tumor by the American Joint Committee on Cancer classification.

We found that 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene are increasing the risk of cancer in the second degree of advancement in relation to the first degree.</p>",
                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC. For 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>, we can observe increased risk in the case of Gln/His-Asp/Glu pair, but at the same time, coincidence of genotypes Gln/His-Glu/Glu and His/His-Asp/Asp decreases the risk. For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly. Moreover, increased risk of colorectal cancer was revealed for pairs Gln/His-Arg/Arg (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>), Val/Val-Asp/Glu (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Val/Val-Gly/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>), and Asp/Glu-Gly/Ala (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>); while at the same time, risk was decreased for pairs Ile/Val-Asp/Asp (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>), Ile/Val-Gly/Gly, and Ile/Val-Ala/Ala (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>) as well as Asp/Asp-Gly/Ala and Asp/Glu-Gly/Gly (148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>). In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend.

                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC.

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis.

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis.

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>].

Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV).

A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV).

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms.

That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend.

One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

It has been revealed that genotype pair Gln/His-Val/Val for 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk of CRC.

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may affect the activity of the BER (base excision repair) and NER (nucleotide excision repair) systems. Using DNA isolated from blood taken from patients (<italic>n</italic> = 312) and a control group (<italic>n</italic> = 320) with CRC, we have analyzed the polymorphisms of selected DNA repair genes and we have demonstrated that genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. At the same time analyzing the gene-gene interactions, we suggest the thesis that the main factor to be considered when analyzing the impact of polymorphisms on the risk of malignant transformation should be intergenic interactions. Moreover, we are suggesting that some polymorphisms may have impact not only on the malignant transformation but also on the stage of the tumor.</p>",
                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>].

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>].

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>.

In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",

NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth.

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk.

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>].

Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired.

Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>].

However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

                            "<p>Currently, we are observing an increase of the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2012, according to GLOBCAN, there were 1360000 new CRC cases, which with 9.7% made it the third most common cancer after lung and breast cancers [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>, <xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>]. While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>].

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>].

Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005).

It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>).

                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor.

The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>].

At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",

However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018).

Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>"

While causes of CRC remain unknown, it is estimated that about 20% of cancer cases are familial and approximately 3% are caused by mutations of strongly predisposed genes [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>, <xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Studies have shown that individual predispositions for developing this cancer may depend on genetic changes, including changes in genes involved in the process of DNA repair, which is responsible for dealing with DNA damages [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with colorectal cancer susceptibility; most of them are part of mismatch DNA repair system (MMR) [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B10\" ref-type=\"bibr\">10</xref>]. However, besides MMR system in mammalian cells, there are three more basic mechanisms of DNA repair: BER (base excision repair), NER (nucleotide excision repair), and DSB (double-strand brakes), which are currently under strong investigation in terms of connection with an increased risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In this paper, we study the selected polymorphisms of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) pathways and their impact on modulating risk of colorectal cancer occurrence. Among the known polymorphisms of the DNA repair genes, the polymorphisms of <italic>ERCC4</italic> and <italic>XPA</italic> genes from NER pathway have been repeatedly studied as potentially connected with susceptibility to the occurrence of various cancers [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. NER is a particularly important excision mechanism that removes DNA damage induced by ultraviolet light (UV). UV DNA damage results in bulky DNA adducts\u2014these adducts are mostly thymine dimers and 6,4-photoproducts. The importance of NER is evidenced by the severe human diseases that result from in-born genetic mutations of NER proteins such as xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>, <xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. The second studied pathway\u2014BER\u2014is a DNA repair system that operates on small lesions such as oxidized or reduced bases. A single damaged base is removed by base-specific DNA glycosylases and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites are created (that can occur also by spontaneous hydrolysis or by DNA damaging agents). AP sites are premutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication and therefore need to be identified and repaired. Whole process is initiated by the major AP endonuclease in human cells coded by <italic>APEX</italic> gene, whose polymorphisms have been so far connected to several types of cancer [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>]. Moreover, our goal was to evaluate the mutual action of those two DNA repair systems on modulating CRC risk.</p>",

For pair 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>, we observed increased risk in the case of genotypes Gln/His-Gly/Ala and His/His-Gly/Ala and decreased risk for Gln/His-Gly/Gly.

In addition, worth noticing is the major impact of Asp/Glu genotype of 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> gene when paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>, and similarly, Gly/Ala genotype again paired with all genotypes of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>.</p>",

                            "<p>All cells of the human body are constantly exposed to damaging agents, which can cause changes in the DNA. These changes, if not repaired, may lie at the basis of the process of carcinogenesis. To cope with those damages, the human body has developed a number of DNA repair mechanisms, including BER and NER systems. One of the key elements of BER is <italic>APEX</italic> gene product\u2014class II AP endonuclease. Endonuclease cleaves the phosphodiester backbone 5\u2032 to the AP site, thereby initiating a repair process [<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>]. Polymorphisms in <italic>APEX</italic> gene have been for a long time a subject of interest in the area of modulating risk of malignant transformation and many of them have been connected to several types of cancers such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or bladder cancer [<xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. In the case of colorectal cancer, it has been estimated that <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu is involved in increasing CRC risk [<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] which is consistent with our results. However, some researchers suggest that there is no association between increased cancer risk and the <italic>APEX</italic> Asp148Glu polymorphisms [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>] or even that its occurrence decreases the risk\u2014Brevik et al. report that carriers of the <italic>APEX</italic> codon 51 Gln/His genotype had a reduced CRC risk compared with carriers of the Gln/Gln genotype [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. In contrast to these reports, we in our study found that Gln/His genotype increases the CRC risk. Similar differences can be observed in the case of NER system genes studied by us\u201423Gly/Ala of <italic>XPA</italic> gene is suggested to have no influence on risk of colorectal cancer [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>], while our results indicate the opposite (odds ratio (OR) 5.373 (3.418\u20138.446); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab4\">Table 4</xref>). We believe that the cause of such divergence may lie in different selections of the study group (presented studies were carried out on the Japanese and Turkish populations while our research was on the Polish population) as well as bias in the selection because of the diet (eating red meat) and smoking tobacco, since it has been proven that ethnic group as well as other factors have a significant impact on the modulation of the risk of particular diseases [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>]. However, in our opinion, the main factor that could cause individual differences in modulation of risk by the same polymorphisms is gene-gene interactions. Several studies have confirmed that the polymorphisms of individual genes can significantly change the level of risk in case of coexistence with other specific polymorphisms. This phenomenon is observed even in cases when those polymorphisms do not have a significant effect on the modulation of the cancer risk when studied without mentioned coexistence [<xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. Therefore, in the second part of this work, we have made calculations of gene-gene interactions to test the impact of a joint action examined in earlier polymorphisms. Results are shown in <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab7\">Table 7</xref>. The first thing worth noting is the increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 64Val/Val of <italic>APEX</italic> gene when compared to risk associated only with 51Gln/His (OR 2.266 (1.120\u20134.585); <italic>p</italic> = 0.022 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005) and similar increased risk of CRC in the case of co-occurrence of genotype 51Gln/His of <italic>APEX</italic> gene with 689Arg/Arg ERCC4 (OR 2.464 (1.247\u20134.870); <italic>p</italic> = 0.009 versus 1.706 (1.174\u20132.480); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Similar increased risk can also be seen in the case of pairs 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic>; however, 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 23Gly/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> also considered individually increased risk of CRC. That is why we want to pay special attention to the first two pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-64Val/Val <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-689Arg/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic>) in which only 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic> increases the risk, but in the case of coexistence with the aforementioned polymorphisms, this risk becomes even greater. In our opinion, this clearly indicates a much more advanced system of impact of polymorphisms on the risk of cancer than the effect of a SNP. It can also indicate the interaction of BER and NER systems in removing damage which has been suggested by other researchers [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>]. Confirmation of the thesis of common effect of polymorphisms of different genes to modulate the risk of cancer is also observed by us as protective effect in form of reducing the risk of CRC for genotype pairs (51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-148Glu/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> and 51Gln/His <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>) where one of the polymorphisms previously increased the risk, so we can see a reversal of the trend. It is also worth noting that the protective effect may have a pair in which none of the polymorphisms, when considered individually, showed no previous effect on the risk of CRC increasing nor decreasing it (64Ile/Val <italic>APEX</italic>-23Ala/Ala <italic>XPA</italic> and 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic>-23Gly/Gly <italic>XPA</italic>). Finally, we want to draw attention to the fact that genotype 148Asp/Glu <italic>APEX</italic> which itself increases the risk of CRC (OR 2.588 (1.736\u20133.859); <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), when considered along with any polymorphism of 689Ser/Arg <italic>ERCC4</italic> (Ser/Ser, Ser/Arg, or Arg/Arg), will always show a greater risk than alone (OR, resp., 2.716 (1.293\u20135.704), <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, 2.963 (1.467\u20135.985), <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, and 2.643 (1.171\u20135.965), <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). In our opinion, this confirms the thesis pronounced earlier that the gene-gene interactions are the main factor that may influence individual differences in the predisposition to the occurrence of cancer.</p>",
                            "<p>Given such a complicated set of factors and their mutual interactions that may cause malignant transformation, it should be also suspected that there can be whole set of various factors contributing to the progression of already formed tumor. In order to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms of analyzed genes on the progress of colorectal cancer, we have correlated the distribution of genotypes with the progress of the tumor according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Increased risk of CRC in the II\u00b0 of advancement in relation to the I\u00b0 was observed in the case of 148Asp/Glu polymorphism of <italic>APEX</italic> gene and 23Gly/Ala polymorphism of XPA gene (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"tab8\">Table 8</xref>). The observed effect is consistent with the effect of the polymorphisms in the increased risk of disease onset, which may suggest the relationship between specific genotypes and initiation and promotion of carcinogenesis as well as the progression of cancer and metastasis. This is in line with our earlier studies in which we presented similar thesis [<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. In our opinion, this allows not only to identify patients with an increased risk of cancer but also to identify within the group of patients already diagnosed with the disease to predict potential tumor growth and thus allows a more comprehensive approach to treating patients.</p>",
                            "<p>Genotypes 51Gln/His and 148Asp/Glu of APEX gene and 23Gly/Ala of XPA gene may increase the risk of CRC, while polymorphisms of 64Ile/Val of APEX gene and 689Ser/Arg of ERCC4 gene have no effect on modulating the risk. At the same time, gene-gene interactions may completely change the risk level; therefore, we advocate that they should be considered as very important factors when calculating the risk factor. Moreover, polymorphisms of BER and NER systems may not only initiate malignant transformation but also be able to contribute to tumor growth. We believe that our results are promising, yet further studies are needed on this subject to establish an incontestable link between a given polymorphism and its phenotypic effect in the modulation of BER and NER activity and thus its impact on carcinogenesis.</p>",
