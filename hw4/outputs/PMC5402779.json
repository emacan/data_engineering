Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>"

Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32.

A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners.

                            "<p>In this report, we made a thorough assessment of the validity of the school entry vision screening in Iran. Some previous studies have examined the validity of preschool exams in certain cities (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>). Nonetheless, this study has many strong points compared to previous studies, which include random sampling, larger sample size, obtaining results generalized to the entire country, more detailed report and suggesting diagnostic cut points. Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",

                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Cost is one of the important factors in decision making about screening programs. However, since the main objective of these programs is timely identification and treatment of vision disorders, one must note the efficacy and accuracy as well. These screenings are very cost-effective in Iran, however, employing optometrists can increase the program effectiveness but also the costs (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>, <xref rid=\"B25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>). Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders. While, optometrists can improve the sensitivity of the screening test, they have an uneven distribution throughout the nation, therefore, enhancing the knowledge of teachers and other school personnel, as well as their training, is another solution for reducing positive and negative false results (<xref rid=\"B26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>On the other hand, in designing screening programs, we can improve sensitivity rates through other approaches such as changing the cut point. The best cut point for uncorrected visual acuity that provided the highest sensitivity and specificity rates was 0.1. In other words, schoolchildren with vision equal to or worse than 20/25 need to be referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist. While, this cut point can lead to a higher number of false positive results compared to the previous one, the advantage is that false negative cases will be minimized. Therefore, we recommend using supplementary methods such as objective refraction to reduce the false positive rate. Overall, our findings revealed low validity and high false negative rates for first graders\u2019 vision screening tests performed early in every school year, and this leads to negligence of children with vision problems and imposition of financial burden to the government because most parents rely on test results. Therefore, one priority for the health system is to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The validity of the tests can be improved by training the examiners of the screening program, using objective instruments, and supplementary methods for measure indices other than visual acuity.</p>",

The most notable strong points include assessment of the status of the school entry vision-screening program through cluster sampling from the entire country and the large sample size. Limitations include lack of access to follow-up information regarding those who had screened positive by health care workers and lack of sufficient data for assessing the cost-effectiveness screening by optometrists.</p>",

Based on the Youden\u2019s index, the best-associated criterion was an uncorrected visual acuity more than 0.05 Log-MAR with 67.3% sensitivity and 74.7% specificity.</p>",
                            "<p>In this report, we made a thorough assessment of the validity of the school entry vision screening in Iran. Some previous studies have examined the validity of preschool exams in certain cities (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>). Nonetheless, this study has many strong points compared to previous studies, which include random sampling, larger sample size, obtaining results generalized to the entire country, more detailed report and suggesting diagnostic cut points. Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Cost is one of the important factors in decision making about screening programs. However, since the main objective of these programs is timely identification and treatment of vision disorders, one must note the efficacy and accuracy as well. These screenings are very cost-effective in Iran, however, employing optometrists can increase the program effectiveness but also the costs (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>, <xref rid=\"B25\" ref-type=\"bibr\">25</xref>). Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders. While, optometrists can improve the sensitivity of the screening test, they have an uneven distribution throughout the nation, therefore, enhancing the knowledge of teachers and other school personnel, as well as their training, is another solution for reducing positive and negative false results (<xref rid=\"B26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>On the other hand, in designing screening programs, we can improve sensitivity rates through other approaches such as changing the cut point. The best cut point for uncorrected visual acuity that provided the highest sensitivity and specificity rates was 0.1. In other words, schoolchildren with vision equal to or worse than 20/25 need to be referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist. While, this cut point can lead to a higher number of false positive results compared to the previous one, the advantage is that false negative cases will be minimized. Therefore, we recommend using supplementary methods such as objective refraction to reduce the false positive rate. Overall, our findings revealed low validity and high false negative rates for first graders\u2019 vision screening tests performed early in every school year, and this leads to negligence of children with vision problems and imposition of financial burden to the government because most parents rely on test results. Therefore, one priority for the health system is to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The validity of the tests can be improved by training the examiners of the screening program, using objective instruments, and supplementary methods for measure indices other than visual acuity.</p>"

A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",

Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population.

In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>).

Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners.

Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist.

Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies.

Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist.

Some previous studies have examined the validity of preschool exams in certain cities (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>). Nonetheless, this study has many strong points compared to previous studies, which include random sampling, larger sample size, obtaining results generalized to the entire country, more detailed report and suggesting diagnostic cut points. Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",

Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders.

                            "<p>In this report, we made a thorough assessment of the validity of the school entry vision screening in Iran. Some previous studies have examined the validity of preschool exams in certain cities (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>). Nonetheless, this study has many strong points compared to previous studies, which include random sampling, larger sample size, obtaining results generalized to the entire country, more detailed report and suggesting diagnostic cut points. Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Cost is one of the important factors in decision making about screening programs. However, since the main objective of these programs is timely identification and treatment of vision disorders, one must note the efficacy and accuracy as well.

Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders. While, optometrists can improve the sensitivity of the screening test, they have an uneven distribution throughout the nation, therefore, enhancing the knowledge of teachers and other school personnel, as well as their training, is another solution for reducing positive and negative false results (<xref rid=\"B26\" ref-type=\"bibr\">26</xref>).</p>",

Some previous studies have examined the validity of preschool exams in certain cities (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>). Nonetheless, this study has many strong points compared to previous studies, which include random sampling, larger sample size, obtaining results generalized to the entire country, more detailed report and suggesting diagnostic cut points. Our findings indicated a sensitivity rate of 38.15% for screening based on a visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32. A previous study, conducted in Mashhad, reported a rate of 37.5% (<xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>In our study, the predictive value of uncorrected vision testing for screening was 33.93%. The predictive value in our study is lower than that in most previous studies. This is while in some regions or even our neighboring countries such as Oman, rates as high as 99.1% and 99.6% have been reported in Batinaand Dahiram, respectively (<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>). Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",
                            "<p>Cost is one of the important factors in decision making about screening programs. However, since the main objective of these programs is timely identification and treatment of vision disorders, one must note the efficacy and accuracy as well.

Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders.

A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners.

Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist.

Throughout Iran, non-optometrist personnel conduct both screenings for preschoolers and first graders.

                            "<p>On the other hand, in designing screening programs, we can improve sensitivity rates through other approaches such as changing the cut point. The best cut point for uncorrected visual acuity that provided the highest sensitivity and specificity rates was 0.1.

While, this cut point can lead to a higher number of false positive results compared to the previous one, the advantage is that false negative cases will be minimized. Therefore, we recommend using supplementary methods such as objective refraction to reduce the false positive rate. Overall, our findings revealed low validity and high false negative rates for first graders\u2019 vision screening tests performed early in every school year, and this leads to negligence of children with vision problems and imposition of financial burden to the government because most parents rely on test results. Therefore, one priority for the health system is to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The validity of the tests can be improved by training the examiners of the screening program, using objective instruments, and supplementary methods for measure indices other than visual acuity.</p>"

Unlike other reports, which have high false positive rates, the rate was quite low in our study (<xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">21</xref>, <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">22</xref>). Positive predictive value correlated inversely with the false positive rate. In other words, a diagnostic test with a low predictive value has a high rate of false positive cases among the screening population. False positive cases, which have no particular problem, are then referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further care and follow up, and this imposes surplus expenses on the health system. On the other hand, parents\u2019 anxiety and concern about their children\u2019s visual health may not be resolved after their follow-up visit with an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Therefore, to improve the predictive value in low-prevalence areas, supplementary tests such as refraction need to be used to identify and refer children with vision problems (<xref rid=\"B23\" ref-type=\"bibr\">23</xref>, <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">24</xref>).</p>",

                            "<p>Considering the long history of the screening program, we assumed examiners would be better experienced and expected to see a higher sensitivity rate, but the rate in our study is lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>) (<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>, <xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>). A notable point in this finding is the false negative results. Throughout the country, more than 60% of first graders who have visual acuity equal to or worse than 20/32 is not identified through the screening program and this is while their parents will not seek vision testing because their children have already been examined at school. The sensitivity of the tests in Iran is much lower than that in other countries (<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">Table 5</xref>). The reported rate in a country like Sweden is also 33% (<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>), however, study participants in Sweden were three yr old children and their responses are less valid as well. In another study concerning vision screening in Iranian children, the sensitivity rate was about 74.5% that is significantly higher than our study. This considerable difference can be attributed to the examiners and a final cut point of 20/30 compared to 20/25 in our study (<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>). Covering a wide range of diseases can lead to reduced sensitivity but in our study, we only focused on two diseases, and thus, the low sensitivity rate is by no means negligible (<xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>). In some parts of the world, objective instruments are used in addition to uncorrected vision testing. Therefore, the current examinations performed in Iran might require a change of method and proper training of the examiners. In addition to their ease of use, objective methods have shown high levels of accuracy in identifying cases with refractive errors and amblyopia without sacrificing the sensitivity of the test or any need for cycloplegia (<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>, <xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>). In addition, the instruments have high positive predictive values and can be used for screening purposes by a lay person (<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>).</p>",

The best cut point for uncorrected visual acuity that provided the highest sensitivity and specificity rates was 0.1. In other words, schoolchildren with vision equal to or worse than 20/25 need to be referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist. While, this cut point can lead to a higher number of false positive results compared to the previous one, the advantage is that false negative cases will be minimized. Therefore, we recommend using supplementary methods such as objective refraction to reduce the false positive rate. Overall, our findings revealed low validity and high false negative rates for first graders\u2019 vision screening tests performed early in every school year, and this leads to negligence of children with vision problems and imposition of financial burden to the government because most parents rely on test results. Therefore, one priority for the health system is to increase the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. The validity of the tests can be improved by training the examiners of the screening program, using objective instruments, and supplementary methods for measure indices other than visual acuity.</p>"
