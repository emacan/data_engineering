        "abstract": "<p>Basic research of gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) has demonstrated the combination effects of gefitinib and chemotherapy were sequence-dependent. To evaluate the efficacy of sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor response or partial response to two to three cycles of chemotherapy, a phase II clinical trial was done in Chinese patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p>\n<p>Thirty-three consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC that had been pretreated with at least one chemotherapeutic regimen and were responding to chemotherapy following 2 to 3 cycles of treatment, entered the trial from May 2004 to February 2006. Patients received gefitinib at an oral dose of 250 mg once daily for 4 weeks.</p>\n<p>Thirty-three patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. The objective response rate was 24.2% (8 of 33)(95% CI, 11% to 42%). The symptom improvement rate was 54.5% (18 of 33) (95% CI, 41% to 69%). The median duration of response was 7 months (95%CI, 4.0 to 13.2 months). The median time to disease progression (TTP) was 6.5 months (95%CI, 0.7 to 16.6 months). The median overall survival time (OS) was 9.8 months (range, 2.1 to 18.0 months), and the actuarial 1-year survival was 36.4%. Toxicity was relatively mild and included only one patient (3.0%) with grade 4 diarrhea, 1 (3.0%) with grade 3 rash, 1 (3.0%) with grade 3 nausea, and 1 with grade 3 vomiting (3.0%).</p>\n<p>Preliminary results suggest that sequential administration of gefitinib following a response to chemotherapy may be beneficial for Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC. Further randomized clinical trials are needed.</p>",

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy.

Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib.

The overall disease control rate, including CR, PR and SD, was 93.9%. A comparable response rate was observed for adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma patients as 8 of the 24 patients with adenocarcinoma had a major objective response (33.3%), while none of the 9 patients with squamous carcinoma had a major objective response. Rapid tumor regression was demonstrated for most of the responders. Among these responders, 7 patients (87.5%) obtained an objective response as measured by the first post-baseline assessment. One patient met the response criteria in the second month.

                            "<p>This paper describes the first phase II trial of sequential administration of gefitinib following tumor responses to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The TTP and OS observed are encouraging, although patient selection bias cannot be excluded. It is unclear whether having achieved a response from chemotherapy influences the efficacy of subsequent gefitinib. It should be noted that the TTP and OS registered in this study are comparable to historical data obtained in patients who received first-line chemotherapy for six cycles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>].

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Based on our clinical experience, response is usually apparent after the initial two to three cycles of chemotherapy. This means that subsequent chemotherapy of three to four cycles, 2.3 to 3.0 months, is only to consolidate the clinical response obtained. These regimens yield median duration of response of 4 to 6 months in advanced patients who have thus been experiencing chemotherapy with about 50% to 70% median duration of response and only 30% remission time free of chemotherapy and its associated toxicity.</p>",

The TTP and OS observed are encouraging, although patient selection bias cannot be excluded. It is unclear whether having achieved a response from chemotherapy influences the efficacy of subsequent gefitinib. It should be noted that the TTP and OS registered in this study are comparable to historical data obtained in patients who received first-line chemotherapy for six cycles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. Although chemotherapy had administered two or three cycles at the physician's discretion, the TTP in this study is comparable to the duration of response of continuous chemotherapy reported in the literature.

                            "<p>To date, second-line chemotherapy has only shown modest efficacy in advanced NSCLC with overall RRs ranging from 6% to 25%, median duration of response ranging from 1.2 months to 7.5 months, and median OS ranging from 3.2 months to 9.5 months [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",
                            "<p>Some evidence had demonstrating that chemosensitivity is mainly related to the proliferative activity of tumor cells and reductions of the proliferation rate are associated with chemoresistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Clinical study demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC have subjective symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, and impairment of performance status [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]. Since QOL is a major end point of second-line chemotherapy, severe toxicity is not acceptable in this setting. However, grades 3 and 4 toxicities were frequently reported in the PC, GC or NP regimens [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Based on our clinical experience, response is usually apparent after the initial two to three cycles of chemotherapy. This means that subsequent chemotherapy of three to four cycles, 2.3 to 3.0 months, is only to consolidate the clinical response obtained. These regimens yield median duration of response of 4 to 6 months in advanced patients who have thus been experiencing chemotherapy with about 50% to 70% median duration of response and only 30% remission time free of chemotherapy and its associated toxicity.</p>",

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",
                            "<p>Some evidence had demonstrating that chemosensitivity is mainly related to the proliferative activity of tumor cells and reductions of the proliferation rate are associated with chemoresistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Clinical study demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC have subjective symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, and impairment of performance status [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]. Since QOL is a major end point of second-line chemotherapy, severe toxicity is not acceptable in this setting.

Based on our clinical experience, response is usually apparent after the initial two to three cycles of chemotherapy. This means that subsequent chemotherapy of three to four cycles, 2.3 to 3.0 months, is only to consolidate the clinical response obtained. These regimens yield median duration of response of 4 to 6 months in advanced patients who have thus been experiencing chemotherapy with about 50% to 70% median duration of response and only 30% remission time free of chemotherapy and its associated toxicity.</p>"

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates.

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Clinical study demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC have subjective symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, and impairment of performance status [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>].

                            "<p>This paper describes the first phase II trial of sequential administration of gefitinib following tumor responses to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. The TTP and OS observed are encouraging, although patient selection bias cannot be excluded. It is unclear whether having achieved a response from chemotherapy influences the efficacy of subsequent gefitinib. It should be noted that the TTP and OS registered in this study are comparable to historical data obtained in patients who received first-line chemotherapy for six cycles [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>]. Although chemotherapy had administered two or three cycles at the physician's discretion, the TTP in this study is comparable to the duration of response of continuous chemotherapy reported in the literature. Furthermore, the calculations of OS in continuous chemotherapy and in sequential gefitinib are both from the start of responding chemotherapy until death.</p>",
                            "<p>To date, second-line chemotherapy has only shown modest efficacy in advanced NSCLC with overall RRs ranging from 6% to 25%, median duration of response ranging from 1.2 months to 7.5 months, and median OS ranging from 3.2 months to 9.5 months [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",
                            "<p>Some evidence had demonstrating that chemosensitivity is mainly related to the proliferative activity of tumor cells and reductions of the proliferation rate are associated with chemoresistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",
                            "<p>It has been reported that the overall RRs of PC, GC and NP regimens are 30% to 40% in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients, with CRs of less than 5%. The RR was lower in second-line settings, varying from 6% to 21% [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B29\">29</xref>]. Clinical study demonstrated that a significant proportion of patients with advanced NSCLC have subjective symptoms, such as anorexia, weight loss, and impairment of performance status [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B28\">28</xref>]. Since QOL is a major end point of second-line chemotherapy, severe toxicity is not acceptable in this setting. However, grades 3 and 4 toxicities were frequently reported in the PC, GC or NP regimens [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Based on our clinical experience, response is usually apparent after the initial two to three cycles of chemotherapy. This means that subsequent chemotherapy of three to four cycles, 2.3 to 3.0 months, is only to consolidate the clinical response obtained. These regimens yield median duration of response of 4 to 6 months in advanced patients who have thus been experiencing chemotherapy with about 50% to 70% median duration of response and only 30% remission time free of chemotherapy and its associated toxicity.</p>",

Since QOL is a major end point of second-line chemotherapy, severe toxicity is not acceptable in this setting. However, grades 3 and 4 toxicities were frequently reported in the PC, GC or NP regimens [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Based on our clinical experience, response is usually apparent after the initial two to three cycles of chemotherapy. This means that subsequent chemotherapy of three to four cycles, 2.3 to 3.0 months, is only to consolidate the clinical response obtained. These regimens yield median duration of response of 4 to 6 months in advanced patients who have thus been experiencing chemotherapy with about 50% to 70% median duration of response and only 30% remission time free of chemotherapy and its associated toxicity.</p>",

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates.

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib.

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy.

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling.

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy.

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling.

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy.

Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib.

By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib.

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",

In this regard, chemotherapy is more effective in tumors with higher proliferative rates. The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

The clinical efficacy of chemotherapy could be influenced by the simultaneous administration of gefitinib, which leads to a decrease in growth factor signaling. Furthermore, our previous <italic>in vitro </italic>studies reported that the sequential administration of EGFR inhibitors after chemotherapy may enhance/maintain chemotherapy-induced cancer cell damage [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>]. By contrast, subsequent gefitinib will not be expected to achieve its potential synergy with chemotherapy if a tumor did not respond to chemotherapy. Considering that the combination effect is schedule-dependent, the rationale would be to administer the gefitinib when chemotherapy is inducing or has induced maximum tumor damage. Thus, in the present trial, only patients with an MR or PR to chemotherapy were included. Although one patient (3%) achieved a CR, the sequential administration of gefitinib following a minor or partial response to chemotherapy did not appear to result in a greater RR than with single agent gefitinib. The TTP and OS achieved using this sequential administration strategy were comparable to those attained with combination chemotherapy regimens including paclitaxel plus cisplatin (PC), gemcitibine plus cisplatin (GC) or navelbine plus cisplatin (NP).</p>",

Previous studies indicated that second-line chemotherapy mainly plays a palliation role in advanced NSCLC. The QOL improvement in chemotherapy is mainly dependent on its efficacy. Patients with advanced NSCLC usually have an extremely poor prognosis and exhibit severe symptoms if their tumor progresses after chemotherapy. Therefore, this trial sought to increase or maintain the efficacy of chemotherapy by adding gefitinib after tumors responded to chemotherapy.</p>",
