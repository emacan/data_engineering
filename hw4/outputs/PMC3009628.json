        "abstract": "<p>No prior studies have examined systematic bias in the musculoskeletal physical examination. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of bias due to prior knowledge of lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging findings (MRI) on perceived diagnostic accuracy of the physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy.</p>\n<p>This was a cross-sectional comparison of the performance characteristics of the physical examination with blinding to MRI results (the 'independent group') with performance in the situation where the physical examination was not blinded to MRI results (the 'non-independent group'). The reference standard was the final diagnostic impression of nerve root impingement by the examining physician. Subjects were recruited from a hospital-based outpatient specialty spine clinic. All adults age 18 and older presenting with lower extremity radiating pain of duration \u2264 12 weeks were evaluated for participation. 154 consecutively recruited subjects with lumbar disk herniation confirmed by lumbar spine MRI were included in this study. Sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals were calculated in the independent and non-independent groups for the four components of the radiculopathy examination: 1) provocative testing, 2) motor strength testing, 3) pinprick sensory testing, and 4) deep tendon reflex testing.</p>\n<p>The perceived sensitivity of sensory testing was higher with prior knowledge of MRI results (20% vs. 36%; p = 0.05). Sensitivities and specificities for exam components otherwise showed no statistically significant differences between groups.</p>\n<p>Prior knowledge of lumbar MRI results may introduce bias into the pinprick sensory testing component of the physical examination for lumbar radiculopathy. No statistically significant effect of bias was seen for other components of the physical examination. The effect of bias due to prior knowledge of lumbar MRI results should be considered when an isolated sensory deficit on examination is used in medical decision-making. Further studies of bias should include surgical clinic populations and other common diagnoses including shoulder, knee and hip pathology.</p>",

The physical examination consisted of four components: 1) provocative testing, 2) motor strength testing, 3) pinprick sensation testing, and 4) deep tendon reflex testing. Although manual muscle testing (MMT) is most commonly used for the grading of motor strength, we substituted two functional tests of strength in lieu of MMT: the heel-raise test for detection of S1 involvement, and the sit-to-stand test for detection of L3 involvement; the performance characteristics of the latter test have been reported elsewhere. Each participant was examined by one of six board-certified physiatrists specializing in spine care. All physical examination tests were performed bilaterally. Testing results were documented by the examiner in reference to the symptomatic limb; for example, a positive SLR was documented if positive for reproduction of radicular pain in the symptomatic limb. In a minority of cases, where bilateral symptoms existed, the results of testing were documented in reference to the limb that was most painful. The examining physician prospectively recorded information on demographics, historical features, and physical examination findings for all participants using a standardized data sheet.</p>",

Specific physical examination tests are therefore conceptually most appropriate for the detection of specific pathology. For example, the straight leg raise test is most clinically applicable for the detection of nerve root pathology at either the L5 or S1 levels (low lumbar impingement)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], while the femoral stretch test is most applicable for the detection of nerve root pathology at the L2, L3, or L4 levels (midlumbar impingement)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>]. On the other hand, some tests are most applicable for the detection of level-specific nerve root involvement, such as in the case of Achilles reflex testing for S1 pathology[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. Although various classification systems exist for relationships between physical examination tests and the localization of level-specific nerve root dysfunction, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classification for sensory and motor testing at the L2-S1 levels is commonly used by spine physiatrists[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>]. Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> summarizes the relationships between individual physical examination tests and the specific nerve root levels or combinations of levels they are intended to test, and as utilized in our analytic approach. The system of classification as presented in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> is consistent with the ASIA classification[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], textbooks of neurophysiology[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>], and is reflective of standard practice in our clinic.</p>",

Our analytic approach was based on a comparison of test performance characteristics in the independent group (with blinding to spine MRI) and the non-independent group (without blinding to spine MRI), using a reference standard of the final classification of lumbar nerve root impingement by the examining physician. For analytic purposes, we conducted separate analyses for each of the four physical examination components (provocative testing, motor strength testing, pinprick sensation testing, and deep tendon reflex testing). Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> summarizes the relationships between individual physical examination tests and specific nerve root levels or combinations of levels employed in this analysis. We constructed two-by-two contingency tables for each examination component in the independent and non-independent groups separately. Sensory testing and motor testing contingency tables were populated with the results of testing at the individual nerve root level, rather than the results of testing at the subject level. For example, in the construction of the sensory testing contingency table, each subject contributed the results of pinprick sensory testing at each individual sensory level from L2 to S1, for a total of five sensory levels per subject. For provocative testing, each subject contributed the results of straight leg raise testing and crossed straight leg raise testing for the low lumbar levels (L5 or S1), and femoral stretch testing and crossed femoral stretch testing for the midlumbar levels (L2, L3, or L4) to the contingency table. For reflex testing, each subject contributed the results of patellar tendon reflex testing (L4) and Achilles tendon reflex testing (S1) to the contingency table. In this manner, each study subject contributed 'case' information from their symptomatic level of nerve root impingement, as well as 'control' information from non-affected nerve root levels. For example, for motor strength testing, a subject with L3 nerve root impingement contributed 'case' information based on the L3 level, but also contributed 'control' information based on the L2, L4, L5, and S1 levels. We then calculated sensitivities and specificities, including 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test component in both the independent and non-independent groups[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. We compared estimates of sensitivity and specificity between the independent and non-independent groups using the chi-square test.

The physical examination consisted of four components: 1) provocative testing, 2) motor strength testing, 3) pinprick sensation testing, and 4) deep tendon reflex testing. Although manual muscle testing (MMT) is most commonly used for the grading of motor strength, we substituted two functional tests of strength in lieu of MMT: the heel-raise test for detection of S1 involvement, and the sit-to-stand test for detection of L3 involvement; the performance characteristics of the latter test have been reported elsewhere. Each participant was examined by one of six board-certified physiatrists specializing in spine care. All physical examination tests were performed bilaterally. Testing results were documented by the examiner in reference to the symptomatic limb; for example, a positive SLR was documented if positive for reproduction of radicular pain in the symptomatic limb. In a minority of cases, where bilateral symptoms existed, the results of testing were documented in reference to the limb that was most painful.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of New England Baptist Hospital, Boston. Participants were recruited from a hospital spine center between January 2008 and March 2009. All consecutive patients age 18 and older with lower extremity radiating pain for less than 12 weeks were evaluated for participation. For the purposes of this study, participants were allocated to two groups according to whether or not they had lumbar spine MRI available to the examining physician at the time of physical examination: the 'independent group' had no MRI results available, and the 'non-independent group' had available MRI results. Inclusion criteria for both groups were the historical features of radicular pain in an L2, L3, L4, L5, or S1 dermatome, with or without neurological symptoms, with a concordant MRI finding of nerve root impingement due primarily to lumbar disk herniation. Exclusion criteria were known pregnancy; severe active medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would limit study participation; the presence of significant central or neuroforaminal stenosis from reasons other than lumbar disk herniation as the likely cause of radicular pain; infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic cause of radiculopathy; significant degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis suspected of contributing to symptoms; prior lumbar spine surgery at the affected level. With patients who had no MR imaging available (independent group), it was not possible to confirm whether impingement due to LDH was present at the baseline evaluation. For practical reasons, these patients were offered informed consent at the baseline evaluation, but did not contribute information to the analyses presented here unless their subsequent MRI imaging met study criteria (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>).</p>",

The physical examination consisted of four components: 1) provocative testing, 2) motor strength testing, 3) pinprick sensation testing, and 4) deep tendon reflex testing.

Each participant was examined by one of six board-certified physiatrists specializing in spine care. All physical examination tests were performed bilaterally. Testing results were documented by the examiner in reference to the symptomatic limb; for example, a positive SLR was documented if positive for reproduction of radicular pain in the symptomatic limb.

Inclusion criteria for both groups were the historical features of radicular pain in an L2, L3, L4, L5, or S1 dermatome, with or without neurological symptoms, with a concordant MRI finding of nerve root impingement due primarily to lumbar disk herniation. Exclusion criteria were known pregnancy; severe active medical or psychiatric comorbidities that would limit study participation; the presence of significant central or neuroforaminal stenosis from reasons other than lumbar disk herniation as the likely cause of radicular pain; infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic cause of radiculopathy; significant degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis suspected of contributing to symptoms; prior lumbar spine surgery at the affected level.

For example, the straight leg raise test is most clinically applicable for the detection of nerve root pathology at either the L5 or S1 levels (low lumbar impingement)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], while the femoral stretch test is most applicable for the detection of nerve root pathology at the L2, L3, or L4 levels (midlumbar impingement)[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>].

For analytic purposes, we conducted separate analyses for each of the four physical examination components (provocative testing, motor strength testing, pinprick sensation testing, and deep tendon reflex testing). Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> summarizes the relationships between individual physical examination tests and specific nerve root levels or combinations of levels employed in this analysis. We constructed two-by-two contingency tables for each examination component in the independent and non-independent groups separately. Sensory testing and motor testing contingency tables were populated with the results of testing at the individual nerve root level, rather than the results of testing at the subject level. For example, in the construction of the sensory testing contingency table, each subject contributed the results of pinprick sensory testing at each individual sensory level from L2 to S1, for a total of five sensory levels per subject. For provocative testing, each subject contributed the results of straight leg raise testing and crossed straight leg raise testing for the low lumbar levels (L5 or S1), and femoral stretch testing and crossed femoral stretch testing for the midlumbar levels (L2, L3, or L4) to the contingency table.

Our analytic approach was based on a comparison of test performance characteristics in the independent group (with blinding to spine MRI) and the non-independent group (without blinding to spine MRI), using a reference standard of the final classification of lumbar nerve root impingement by the examining physician. For analytic purposes, we conducted separate analyses for each of the four physical examination components (provocative testing, motor strength testing, pinprick sensation testing, and deep tendon reflex testing). Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref> summarizes the relationships between individual physical examination tests and specific nerve root levels or combinations of levels employed in this analysis. We constructed two-by-two contingency tables for each examination component in the independent and non-independent groups separately. Sensory testing and motor testing contingency tables were populated with the results of testing at the individual nerve root level, rather than the results of testing at the subject level. For example, in the construction of the sensory testing contingency table, each subject contributed the results of pinprick sensory testing at each individual sensory level from L2 to S1, for a total of five sensory levels per subject. For provocative testing, each subject contributed the results of straight leg raise testing and crossed straight leg raise testing for the low lumbar levels (L5 or S1), and femoral stretch testing and crossed femoral stretch testing for the midlumbar levels (L2, L3, or L4) to the contingency table. For reflex testing, each subject contributed the results of patellar tendon reflex testing (L4) and Achilles tendon reflex testing (S1) to the contingency table. In this manner, each study subject contributed 'case' information from their symptomatic level of nerve root impingement, as well as 'control' information from non-affected nerve root levels. For example, for motor strength testing, a subject with L3 nerve root impingement contributed 'case' information based on the L3 level, but also contributed 'control' information based on the L2, L4, L5, and S1 levels. We then calculated sensitivities and specificities, including 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each test component in both the independent and non-independent groups[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>]. We compared estimates of sensitivity and specificity between the independent and non-independent groups using the chi-square test. All analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.0 (SAS Institute., Cary, NC).</p>"
