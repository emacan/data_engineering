The fungus contaminates a wide range of cereals and nuts like maize, wheat, sorghum, and groundnuts, which serve as staple foods in most parts of Africa. Toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> have been reported to contaminate these products and produce aflatoxins which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and lethal fungal metabolites [<xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Aflatoxins also contaminate feed; hence products like meat, milk, cheese, and eggs get contaminated when animals consume the aflatoxin contaminated feed [<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Aflatoxin B1 is the major type of aflatoxins produced by<italic> A. flavus</italic> [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>].<italic> Aspergillus flavus</italic> is the main fungi producing aflatoxin [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Aflatoxicosis was first reported in Kenya in 1982 [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>].

Records of aflatoxin contamination in food and feed are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions where climatic conditions and storage practices favor growth of fungi [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Aflatoxin production is influenced by aeration, moisture, temperature, and substrate and the control methods under trials like biological [<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], cultural, and chemical ones [<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>] are all based on manipulation of these factors.

                            "<p>Traditionally, many plants have been used successfully for medicinal purposes [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aromatic substances in plants, specifically secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, and tannins, are able to protect plants from invaders such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (2001), 80% of African and Asian communities rely on traditional herbal medicines for primary healthcare.

Photosensitization has also been reported to kill both metabolically active and dormant structures such as conidia, unlike conventional fungicides that kill only metabolically active cells [<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. It involves hitting of a photosensitizer by light of a specific wavelength, which makes the photosensitizer reactive thereby killing the toxigenic cells [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. The technique has been reported as a safe and a potential control of mycotoxigenic fungi [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains. This agrees with [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>] where<italic> S. cordatum</italic> bark (organic extract) exhibited antifungal activity. In this study,<italic> S. cordatum</italic> contains nine bioactive compounds which are 17.6%. These as supported by [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>] were the causes of antifungal activity.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> at a concentration of 450\u2009mg/ml had higher inhibition diameter compared to that of 600\u2009mg/ml. This could have been caused by the thickness of the higher concentration which interfered with diffusion of the extract and hence a lower diameter of inhibition.</p>",

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml. This could have been caused by thickness in the higher concentration which interfered with diffusion.<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> extracts had the highest percentage of bioactive compounds (21.6%). Despite having the highest percentage of bioactive compounds, it did not prove the highest level of antifungal activity. This could be attributed to presence of the bioactive compounds in small amounts.

In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

                            "<p>Organic extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity while the aqueous extracts did not. The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains. This agrees with [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>] where<italic> S. cordatum</italic> bark (organic extract) exhibited antifungal activity. In this study,<italic> S. cordatum</italic> contains nine bioactive compounds which are 17.6%. These as supported by [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>] were the causes of antifungal activity.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> at a concentration of 450\u2009mg/ml had higher inhibition diameter compared to that of 600\u2009mg/ml. This could have been caused by the thickness of the higher concentration which interfered with diffusion of the extract and hence a lower diameter of inhibition.</p>",

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

Despite having the highest percentage of bioactive compounds, it did not prove the highest level of antifungal activity.

Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization.

The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>].

Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>].

In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus.

The higher CFU count in the three controls is an indicator that the visible light plant extract combination was the major cause of conidia inactivation and not light alone or plant extracts alone.</p>",

Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization. They were tested at wavelengths ranging from 280\u2009nm to 436\u2009nm. The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Disinfection of water using the solar energy and plant extracts has been proven. Photodynamic activity was attributed to the presence of quinines and anthraquinones which generate singlet oxygen killing the microorganisms in the water. Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. This parallels our study where plant extracts in combination with toxigenic molecules are exposed to light for a specific duration leading to reduced fungal growth.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the time of exposure of the<italic> A. flavus</italic> and plant extract under light was indirectly proportional to the CFU counts; this indicates that more light exposure led to more spore knockout. This parallels a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where increase in light dose increased the rate of spore knockout. In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts were effective photosensitizers though aqueous extracts had a greater reduction of spores than the organic extracts.

This makes a good background for research on aflatoxins because aflatoxins also dissolve better in organic extracts compared to aqueous ones. The extracts were found to contain bioactive compounds which were the specific causes of antifungal activity. Isolation of these useful bioactive compounds using the guidance of phytochemical results should be done. The bioactive compounds should be produced in larger quantities for use in the control of the toxigenic fungi. The consumable plant extract<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> in this study can act as a good candidate to treat food and feed which can then be dried under sunlight before storage leading to inactivation and death of the toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia.

The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains. This agrees with [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>] where<italic> S. cordatum</italic> bark (organic extract) exhibited antifungal activity.

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

Despite having the highest percentage of bioactive compounds, it did not prove the highest level of antifungal activity.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

The higher CFU count in the three controls is an indicator that the visible light plant extract combination was the major cause of conidia inactivation and not light alone or plant extracts alone.</p>",
                            "<p>The photo degrading effect of plant extracts in this study is supported by a study where viability<italic> Penicillium digitatum </italic>conidia was tested using blue light and a dye (ERY) acting as a photosensitizer. Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization. They were tested at wavelengths ranging from 280\u2009nm to 436\u2009nm. The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Disinfection of water using the solar energy and plant extracts has been proven. Photodynamic activity was attributed to the presence of quinines and anthraquinones which generate singlet oxygen killing the microorganisms in the water. Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. This parallels our study where plant extracts in combination with toxigenic molecules are exposed to light for a specific duration leading to reduced fungal growth.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the time of exposure of the<italic> A. flavus</italic> and plant extract under light was indirectly proportional to the CFU counts; this indicates that more light exposure led to more spore knockout. This parallels a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where increase in light dose increased the rate of spore knockout. In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts were effective photosensitizers though aqueous extracts had a greater reduction of spores than the organic extracts. This is supported by a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where both organic and aqueous extracts were effective though the aqueous extracts had better activity.</p>",

The plants in the selected region were correlated with the biodiversity of the region and they are accessible for research and new developments. Plant extracts are of key importance because bioactive compounds in higher plants are biodegradable and selectively toxic.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the medicinal plant extracts were found effective against conidia of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. </italic>Organic extracts had greater antifungal activity. This makes a good background for research on aflatoxins because aflatoxins also dissolve better in organic extracts compared to aqueous ones. The extracts were found to contain bioactive compounds which were the specific causes of antifungal activity. Isolation of these useful bioactive compounds using the guidance of phytochemical results should be done. The bioactive compounds should be produced in larger quantities for use in the control of the toxigenic fungi. The consumable plant extract<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> in this study can act as a good candidate to treat food and feed which can then be dried under sunlight before storage leading to inactivation and death of the toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia. This is a viable technique to control aflatoxin contamination in storage because consumption of the dead<italic> A. flavus</italic> has no health implications.

                            "<p>This study was undertaken with an aim of exploring the effectiveness of medicinal plant extracts in the control of aflatoxin production. Antifungal properties, photosensitization, and phytochemical composition of aqueous and organic extracts of fruits from<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic>, bark from<italic> Syzygium cordatum, </italic>and leaves from<italic> Prunus africana</italic>,<italic> Ocimum lamiifolium</italic>,<italic> Lippia kituiensis,</italic> and<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> were tested. Spores from four-day-old cultures of previously identified toxigenic fungi, UONV017 and UONV003, were used. Disc diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to test the antifungal activity. The spores were suspended in 2\u2009ml of each extract separately and treated with visible light (420\u2009nm) for varying periods. Organic extracts displayed species and concentration dependent antifungal activity.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the highest zones of inhibition diameters in both strains: UONV017 (mean = 18.50 \u00b1 0.71\u2009mm) and UONV003 (mean = 11.92 \u00b1 0.94\u2009mm) at 600\u2009mg/ml. Aqueous extracts had no antifungal activity because all diameters were below 8\u2009mm.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration at 25\u2009mg/ml against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017. All the plant extracts in combination with light reduced the viability of fungal conidia compared with the controls without light, without extracts, and without both extracts and light. Six bioactive compounds were analyzed in the plant extracts. Medicinal plant extracts in this study can control conidia viability and hence with further development can control toxigenic fungal spread.</p>",

The fungus contaminates a wide range of cereals and nuts like maize, wheat, sorghum, and groundnuts, which serve as staple foods in most parts of Africa. Toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> have been reported to contaminate these products and produce aflatoxins which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and lethal fungal metabolites [<xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Aflatoxins also contaminate feed; hence products like meat, milk, cheese, and eggs get contaminated when animals consume the aflatoxin contaminated feed [<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

Records of aflatoxin contamination in food and feed are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions where climatic conditions and storage practices favor growth of fungi [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Aflatoxin production is influenced by aeration, moisture, temperature, and substrate and the control methods under trials like biological [<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], cultural, and chemical ones [<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>] are all based on manipulation of these factors.

                            "<p>Traditionally, many plants have been used successfully for medicinal purposes [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aromatic substances in plants, specifically secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, and tannins, are able to protect plants from invaders such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (2001), 80% of African and Asian communities rely on traditional herbal medicines for primary healthcare.

It involves hitting of a photosensitizer by light of a specific wavelength, which makes the photosensitizer reactive thereby killing the toxigenic cells [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. The technique has been reported as a safe and a potential control of mycotoxigenic fungi [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. However, very few photosensitizers have been approved clinically for use against toxigenic microbes, hence needing identification of safe photosensitizers. Plant extracts, on the other hand, are biodegradable and hence environmentally friendly [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. The aim of this study is to determine the antifungal activity and phytochemical composition of the plants extracts. The ability of visible light to stimulate the bioactive compounds in the plant extracts (photosensitization) and hence increase in the antifungal activity of the extracts against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus </italic>which causes aflatoxin production will also be tested.</p>",

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

                            "<p>Organic extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity while the aqueous extracts did not. The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains.

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

                            "<p>This study found that both aqueous and organic plant extracts in combination with light inactivated<italic> A. flavus</italic> spores, though the former were more effective.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> which had significant inhibition even in the aqueous form against both strains have been reported to have several antimicrobial abilities [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>].<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> was the second most effective against both strains in the organic form and the most effective in the aqueous form against both strains.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> possess several antimicrobial activities and of significance to this study; the fruit extracts possess antifungal activity against<italic> Aspergillus </italic>spp. [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts of the other four plants,<italic> O. lamiifolium, S. oleracea, P</italic>.<italic> africana,</italic> and<italic> L. kituiensis,</italic> had significant reduction of spores as they had low CFU counts compared to the controls against both strains. All the named plants have been reported to possess several antimicrobial activities [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>, <xref rid=\"B41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]. The higher CFU count in the three controls is an indicator that the visible light plant extract combination was the major cause of conidia inactivation and not light alone or plant extracts alone.</p>",
                            "<p>The photo degrading effect of plant extracts in this study is supported by a study where viability<italic> Penicillium digitatum </italic>conidia was tested using blue light and a dye (ERY) acting as a photosensitizer. Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization. They were tested at wavelengths ranging from 280\u2009nm to 436\u2009nm. The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Disinfection of water using the solar energy and plant extracts has been proven. Photodynamic activity was attributed to the presence of quinines and anthraquinones which generate singlet oxygen killing the microorganisms in the water. Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. This parallels our study where plant extracts in combination with toxigenic molecules are exposed to light for a specific duration leading to reduced fungal growth.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the time of exposure of the<italic> A. flavus</italic> and plant extract under light was indirectly proportional to the CFU counts; this indicates that more light exposure led to more spore knockout. This parallels a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where increase in light dose increased the rate of spore knockout. In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts were effective photosensitizers though aqueous extracts had a greater reduction of spores than the organic extracts. This is supported by a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where both organic and aqueous extracts were effective though the aqueous extracts had better activity.</p>",
                            "<p>Extracts used in this study have not been tested for antifungal activity and photosensitization against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> in another study. The findings of this study, therefore, could fulfill the need of new antifungal structure due to unavailability of effective antifungal agents against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic>, resistance of the fungi to the available methods, and the shortcomings of these methods [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. The plants in the selected region were correlated with the biodiversity of the region and they are accessible for research and new developments. Plant extracts are of key importance because bioactive compounds in higher plants are biodegradable and selectively toxic.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the medicinal plant extracts were found effective against conidia of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. </italic>Organic extracts had greater antifungal activity. This makes a good background for research on aflatoxins because aflatoxins also dissolve better in organic extracts compared to aqueous ones. The extracts were found to contain bioactive compounds which were the specific causes of antifungal activity. Isolation of these useful bioactive compounds using the guidance of phytochemical results should be done. The bioactive compounds should be produced in larger quantities for use in the control of the toxigenic fungi. The consumable plant extract<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> in this study can act as a good candidate to treat food and feed which can then be dried under sunlight before storage leading to inactivation and death of the toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia. This is a viable technique to control aflatoxin contamination in storage because consumption of the dead<italic> A. flavus</italic> has no health implications.

                            "<p>This study was undertaken with an aim of exploring the effectiveness of medicinal plant extracts in the control of aflatoxin production.

Spores from four-day-old cultures of previously identified toxigenic fungi, UONV017 and UONV003, were used. Disc diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to test the antifungal activity. The spores were suspended in 2\u2009ml of each extract separately and treated with visible light (420\u2009nm) for varying periods. Organic extracts displayed species and concentration dependent antifungal activity.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the highest zones of inhibition diameters in both strains: UONV017 (mean = 18.50 \u00b1 0.71\u2009mm) and UONV003 (mean = 11.92 \u00b1 0.94\u2009mm) at 600\u2009mg/ml. Aqueous extracts had no antifungal activity because all diameters were below 8\u2009mm.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration at 25\u2009mg/ml against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017. All the plant extracts in combination with light reduced the viability of fungal conidia compared with the controls without light, without extracts, and without both extracts and light. Six bioactive compounds were analyzed in the plant extracts. Medicinal plant extracts in this study can control conidia viability and hence with further development can control toxigenic fungal spread.</p>",

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Aflatoxins also contaminate feed; hence products like meat, milk, cheese, and eggs get contaminated when animals consume the aflatoxin contaminated feed [<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

Records of aflatoxin contamination in food and feed are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions where climatic conditions and storage practices favor growth of fungi [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Aflatoxin production is influenced by aeration, moisture, temperature, and substrate and the control methods under trials like biological [<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], cultural, and chemical ones [<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>] are all based on manipulation of these factors.

                            "<p>Traditionally, many plants have been used successfully for medicinal purposes [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aromatic substances in plants, specifically secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, and tannins, are able to protect plants from invaders such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (2001), 80% of African and Asian communities rely on traditional herbal medicines for primary healthcare.

It involves hitting of a photosensitizer by light of a specific wavelength, which makes the photosensitizer reactive thereby killing the toxigenic cells [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. The technique has been reported as a safe and a potential control of mycotoxigenic fungi [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>].

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

                            "<p>Organic extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity while the aqueous extracts did not. The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains.

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

                            "<p>This study found that both aqueous and organic plant extracts in combination with light inactivated<italic> A. flavus</italic> spores, though the former were more effective.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> which had significant inhibition even in the aqueous form against both strains have been reported to have several antimicrobial abilities [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>].<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> was the second most effective against both strains in the organic form and the most effective in the aqueous form against both strains.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> possess several antimicrobial activities and of significance to this study; the fruit extracts possess antifungal activity against<italic> Aspergillus </italic>spp. [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts of the other four plants,<italic> O. lamiifolium, S. oleracea, P</italic>.<italic> africana,</italic> and<italic> L. kituiensis,</italic> had significant reduction of spores as they had low CFU counts compared to the controls against both strains. All the named plants have been reported to possess several antimicrobial activities [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>, <xref rid=\"B41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]. The higher CFU count in the three controls is an indicator that the visible light plant extract combination was the major cause of conidia inactivation and not light alone or plant extracts alone.</p>",
                            "<p>The photo degrading effect of plant extracts in this study is supported by a study where viability<italic> Penicillium digitatum </italic>conidia was tested using blue light and a dye (ERY) acting as a photosensitizer. Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization. They were tested at wavelengths ranging from 280\u2009nm to 436\u2009nm. The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Disinfection of water using the solar energy and plant extracts has been proven. Photodynamic activity was attributed to the presence of quinines and anthraquinones which generate singlet oxygen killing the microorganisms in the water. Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. This parallels our study where plant extracts in combination with toxigenic molecules are exposed to light for a specific duration leading to reduced fungal growth.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the time of exposure of the<italic> A. flavus</italic> and plant extract under light was indirectly proportional to the CFU counts; this indicates that more light exposure led to more spore knockout. This parallels a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where increase in light dose increased the rate of spore knockout. In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts were effective photosensitizers though aqueous extracts had a greater reduction of spores than the organic extracts. This is supported by a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where both organic and aqueous extracts were effective though the aqueous extracts had better activity.</p>",
                            "<p>Extracts used in this study have not been tested for antifungal activity and photosensitization against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> in another study. The findings of this study, therefore, could fulfill the need of new antifungal structure due to unavailability of effective antifungal agents against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic>, resistance of the fungi to the available methods, and the shortcomings of these methods [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. The plants in the selected region were correlated with the biodiversity of the region and they are accessible for research and new developments. Plant extracts are of key importance because bioactive compounds in higher plants are biodegradable and selectively toxic.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the medicinal plant extracts were found effective against conidia of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. </italic>Organic extracts had greater antifungal activity. This makes a good background for research on aflatoxins because aflatoxins also dissolve better in organic extracts compared to aqueous ones. The extracts were found to contain bioactive compounds which were the specific causes of antifungal activity. Isolation of these useful bioactive compounds using the guidance of phytochemical results should be done. The bioactive compounds should be produced in larger quantities for use in the control of the toxigenic fungi. The consumable plant extract<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> in this study can act as a good candidate to treat food and feed which can then be dried under sunlight before storage leading to inactivation and death of the toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia. This is a viable technique to control aflatoxin contamination in storage because consumption of the dead<italic> A. flavus</italic> has no health implications.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al.

This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",

Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>].

In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",

All the plant extracts in combination with light reduced the viability of fungal conidia compared with the controls without light, without extracts, and without both extracts and light.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml. This could have been caused by thickness in the higher concentration which interfered with diffusion.<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> extracts had the highest percentage of bioactive compounds (21.6%). Despite having the highest percentage of bioactive compounds, it did not prove the highest level of antifungal activity. This could be attributed to presence of the bioactive compounds in small amounts. Studies by [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">34</xref>, <xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">35</xref>] have proved that bioactive compounds in these plant extracts cause them to have antifungal activity.</p>",
                            "<p>The bioactive compounds detected in this study have been shown to cause antimicrobial activities in other studies through various mechanisms [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>, <xref rid=\"B36\" ref-type=\"bibr\">36</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B38\" ref-type=\"bibr\">38</xref>]. Increase in the concentration of bioactive compounds increases the antifungal activity as reported by [<xref rid=\"B39\" ref-type=\"bibr\">39</xref>]. This supports the increase in antifungal activity caused by increase in plant extract concentration in our study.</p>",
                            "<p>\n<italic>Solanum aculeastrum</italic> that had the highest antifungal activity recorded the lowest MIC values for both strains. The low MIC could be attributed to the enhanced antifungal activity. Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>] found out that the extracts with the highest antifungal activity had the lowest MIC value.</p>",
                            "<p>Strain UONV003 of<italic> A. flavus</italic> proved to be more resistant compared to<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 in terms of inhibition diameters and also MIC though both are toxigenic strains. This could be explained by the fact that pathogenicity varies between different strains of<italic> A. flavus</italic> and strains with higher pathogenicity may exhibit higher resistance. This parallels a study that was carried out to test pathogenicity and toxigenicity of ground nut<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains. Results showed that there was variation in pathogenicity within the same level of toxigenic strains [<xref rid=\"B40\" ref-type=\"bibr\">40</xref>].</p>",

All the named plants have been reported to possess several antimicrobial activities [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>, <xref rid=\"B41\" ref-type=\"bibr\">41</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B43\" ref-type=\"bibr\">43</xref>]. The higher CFU count in the three controls is an indicator that the visible light plant extract combination was the major cause of conidia inactivation and not light alone or plant extracts alone.</p>",
                            "<p>The photo degrading effect of plant extracts in this study is supported by a study where viability<italic> Penicillium digitatum </italic>conidia was tested using blue light and a dye (ERY) acting as a photosensitizer. Blue light alone or the photosensitizer alone did not reduce the viability of the nongerminated conidia as compared to the conidia viability control. The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization. They were tested at wavelengths ranging from 280\u2009nm to 436\u2009nm. The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts. This is explained by the fact that higher concentrations have high number of bioactive compounds which are reactivated by light to inactivate toxigenic microbes.</p>",
                            "<p>Photosensitization effect is attributed to the contents of the plant extracts which have strong absorption at high wavelength range [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. Disinfection of water using the solar energy and plant extracts has been proven. Photodynamic activity was attributed to the presence of quinines and anthraquinones which generate singlet oxygen killing the microorganisms in the water. Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. This parallels our study where plant extracts in combination with toxigenic molecules are exposed to light for a specific duration leading to reduced fungal growth.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the time of exposure of the<italic> A. flavus</italic> and plant extract under light was indirectly proportional to the CFU counts; this indicates that more light exposure led to more spore knockout. This parallels a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where increase in light dose increased the rate of spore knockout. In this study also, spore reduction was higher at the higher plant extract concentration of 600\u2009mg/ml compared to the 450\u2009mg/ml. In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
                            "<p>Both aqueous and organic extracts were effective photosensitizers though aqueous extracts had a greater reduction of spores than the organic extracts. This is supported by a study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>] where both organic and aqueous extracts were effective though the aqueous extracts had better activity.</p>",
                            "<p>Extracts used in this study have not been tested for antifungal activity and photosensitization against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> in another study. The findings of this study, therefore, could fulfill the need of new antifungal structure due to unavailability of effective antifungal agents against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic>, resistance of the fungi to the available methods, and the shortcomings of these methods [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>]. The plants in the selected region were correlated with the biodiversity of the region and they are accessible for research and new developments. Plant extracts are of key importance because bioactive compounds in higher plants are biodegradable and selectively toxic.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study, the medicinal plant extracts were found effective against conidia of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. </italic>Organic extracts had greater antifungal activity. This makes a good background for research on aflatoxins because aflatoxins also dissolve better in organic extracts compared to aqueous ones. The extracts were found to contain bioactive compounds which were the specific causes of antifungal activity. Isolation of these useful bioactive compounds using the guidance of phytochemical results should be done. The bioactive compounds should be produced in larger quantities for use in the control of the toxigenic fungi. The consumable plant extract<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> in this study can act as a good candidate to treat food and feed which can then be dried under sunlight before storage leading to inactivation and death of the toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia. This is a viable technique to control aflatoxin contamination in storage because consumption of the dead<italic> A. flavus</italic> has no health implications. This could be applied to all the plant extracts in this study after a toxicity test to ensure safety.</p>",

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al.

Spores from four-day-old cultures of previously identified toxigenic fungi, UONV017 and UONV003, were used. Disc diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to test the antifungal activity. The spores were suspended in 2\u2009ml of each extract separately and treated with visible light (420\u2009nm) for varying periods. Organic extracts displayed species and concentration dependent antifungal activity.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the highest zones of inhibition diameters in both strains: UONV017 (mean = 18.50 \u00b1 0.71\u2009mm) and UONV003 (mean = 11.92 \u00b1 0.94\u2009mm) at 600\u2009mg/ml. Aqueous extracts had no antifungal activity because all diameters were below 8\u2009mm.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration at 25\u2009mg/ml against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017. All the plant extracts in combination with light reduced the viability of fungal conidia compared with the controls without light, without extracts, and without both extracts and light. Six bioactive compounds were analyzed in the plant extracts. Medicinal plant extracts in this study can control conidia viability and hence with further development can control toxigenic fungal spread.</p>",

The fungus contaminates a wide range of cereals and nuts like maize, wheat, sorghum, and groundnuts, which serve as staple foods in most parts of Africa. Toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> have been reported to contaminate these products and produce aflatoxins which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and lethal fungal metabolites [<xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Aflatoxins also contaminate feed; hence products like meat, milk, cheese, and eggs get contaminated when animals consume the aflatoxin contaminated feed [<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>].

Records of aflatoxin contamination in food and feed are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions where climatic conditions and storage practices favor growth of fungi [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Aflatoxin production is influenced by aeration, moisture, temperature, and substrate and the control methods under trials like biological [<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], cultural, and chemical ones [<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>] are all based on manipulation of these factors.

                            "<p>Traditionally, many plants have been used successfully for medicinal purposes [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aromatic substances in plants, specifically secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, and tannins, are able to protect plants from invaders such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (2001), 80% of African and Asian communities rely on traditional herbal medicines for primary healthcare.

It involves hitting of a photosensitizer by light of a specific wavelength, which makes the photosensitizer reactive thereby killing the toxigenic cells [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. The technique has been reported as a safe and a potential control of mycotoxigenic fungi [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. However, very few photosensitizers have been approved clinically for use against toxigenic microbes, hence needing identification of safe photosensitizers. Plant extracts, on the other hand, are biodegradable and hence environmentally friendly [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. The aim of this study is to determine the antifungal activity and phytochemical composition of the plants extracts. The ability of visible light to stimulate the bioactive compounds in the plant extracts (photosensitization) and hence increase in the antifungal activity of the extracts against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus </italic>which causes aflatoxin production will also be tested.</p>",

[<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>].

In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration.

This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al.

                            "<p>This study was undertaken with an aim of exploring the effectiveness of medicinal plant extracts in the control of aflatoxin production. Antifungal properties, photosensitization, and phytochemical composition of aqueous and organic extracts of fruits from<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic>, bark from<italic> Syzygium cordatum, </italic>and leaves from<italic> Prunus africana</italic>,<italic> Ocimum lamiifolium</italic>,<italic> Lippia kituiensis,</italic> and<italic> Spinacia oleracea</italic> were tested. Spores from four-day-old cultures of previously identified toxigenic fungi, UONV017 and UONV003, were used. Disc diffusion and broth dilution methods were used to test the antifungal activity. The spores were suspended in 2\u2009ml of each extract separately and treated with visible light (420\u2009nm) for varying periods. Organic extracts displayed species and concentration dependent antifungal activity.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the highest zones of inhibition diameters in both strains: UONV017 (mean = 18.50 \u00b1 0.71\u2009mm) and UONV003 (mean = 11.92 \u00b1 0.94\u2009mm) at 600\u2009mg/ml. Aqueous extracts had no antifungal activity because all diameters were below 8\u2009mm.<italic> Solanum aculeastrum</italic> had the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration at 25\u2009mg/ml against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017. All the plant extracts in combination with light reduced the viability of fungal conidia compared with the controls without light, without extracts, and without both extracts and light. Six bioactive compounds were analyzed in the plant extracts. Medicinal plant extracts in this study can control conidia viability and hence with further development can control toxigenic fungal spread.</p>",

The fungus contaminates a wide range of cereals and nuts like maize, wheat, sorghum, and groundnuts, which serve as staple foods in most parts of Africa. Toxigenic<italic> A. flavus</italic> have been reported to contaminate these products and produce aflatoxins which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, and lethal fungal metabolites [<xref rid=\"B2\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2</xref>\u2013<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>]. Aflatoxins also contaminate feed; hence products like meat, milk, cheese, and eggs get contaminated when animals consume the aflatoxin contaminated feed [<xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">6</xref>, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">7</xref>]. Aflatoxin B1 is the major type of aflatoxins produced by<italic> A. flavus</italic> [<xref rid=\"B3\" ref-type=\"bibr\">3</xref>].<italic> Aspergillus flavus</italic> is the main fungi producing aflatoxin [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Aflatoxicosis was first reported in Kenya in 1982 [<xref rid=\"B8\" ref-type=\"bibr\">8</xref>].

Records of aflatoxin contamination in food and feed are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions where climatic conditions and storage practices favor growth of fungi [<xref rid=\"B11\" ref-type=\"bibr\">11</xref>]. Aflatoxin production is influenced by aeration, moisture, temperature, and substrate and the control methods under trials like biological [<xref rid=\"B12\" ref-type=\"bibr\">12</xref>], cultural, and chemical ones [<xref rid=\"B13\" ref-type=\"bibr\">13</xref>] are all based on manipulation of these factors. Many African countries are now in the process of including regulation framework within their food policies to help control exposure to aflatoxins [<xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Traditionally, many plants have been used successfully for medicinal purposes [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Aromatic substances in plants, specifically secondary metabolites like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, and tannins, are able to protect plants from invaders such as fungi, bacteria, and nematodes [<xref rid=\"B14\" ref-type=\"bibr\">14</xref>]. According to World Health Organization (2001), 80% of African and Asian communities rely on traditional herbal medicines for primary healthcare. This is because herbal medicines are safer and cheaper compared to synthetic medicines [<xref rid=\"B15\" ref-type=\"bibr\">15</xref>, <xref rid=\"B16\" ref-type=\"bibr\">16</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>This study exploited the ability of known medicinal plant extracts to control the growth of<italic> A. flavus</italic> conidia. Photosensitization has also been reported to kill both metabolically active and dormant structures such as conidia, unlike conventional fungicides that kill only metabolically active cells [<xref rid=\"B17\" ref-type=\"bibr\">17</xref>]. It involves hitting of a photosensitizer by light of a specific wavelength, which makes the photosensitizer reactive thereby killing the toxigenic cells [<xref rid=\"B18\" ref-type=\"bibr\">18</xref>]. The technique has been reported as a safe and a potential control of mycotoxigenic fungi [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>]. However, very few photosensitizers have been approved clinically for use against toxigenic microbes, hence needing identification of safe photosensitizers. Plant extracts, on the other hand, are biodegradable and hence environmentally friendly [<xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">20</xref>]. The aim of this study is to determine the antifungal activity and phytochemical composition of the plants extracts. The ability of visible light to stimulate the bioactive compounds in the plant extracts (photosensitization) and hence increase in the antifungal activity of the extracts against toxigenic<italic> A. flavus </italic>which causes aflatoxin production will also be tested.</p>",

This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis.

Aflatoxins have been classified as class 1 poisons by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [<xref rid=\"B5\" ref-type=\"bibr\">5</xref>].

The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity. The glycosides, alkaloids, and saponins in<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> fruits have been associated with anticancer (skin and cervix), anti-inflammatory, and anticholesterol activities [<xref rid=\"B30\" ref-type=\"bibr\">30</xref>]. This agrees with the results of [<xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">31</xref>] where organic and aqueous fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> were tested against fungi and bacteria and they had good antimicrobial activity although antifungal activity caused by organic extracts was higher than that caused by aqueous extracts.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> bark extracts had significant antifungal activity against both<italic> A. flavus</italic> strains. This agrees with [<xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">32</xref>] where<italic> S. cordatum</italic> bark (organic extract) exhibited antifungal activity. In this study,<italic> S. cordatum</italic> contains nine bioactive compounds which are 17.6%. These as supported by [<xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">33</xref>] were the causes of antifungal activity.<italic> Syzygium cordatum</italic> at a concentration of 450\u2009mg/ml had higher inhibition diameter compared to that of 600\u2009mg/ml.

They all had varying levels of bioactive compounds which were attributed to the varying levels of antifungal activity and this justifies the use of these plant extracts in ethnomedicine. The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

Despite having the highest percentage of bioactive compounds, it did not prove the highest level of antifungal activity.

In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration.

                            "<p>Organic extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity while the aqueous extracts did not. The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis.

                            "<p>Organic extracts exhibited significant antifungal activity while the aqueous extracts did not. The organic extracts had a higher percentage of bioactive compounds (60.8%) than the aqueous extracts (39.2%). Different solvents have varying levels of solubility for different bioactive compounds. The reason for this sequence in activity may be that bioactive compounds that cause the antimicrobial activity dissolve easily in organic compared to aqueous solvents [<xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">27</xref>]. This supports earlier findings that organic leaf extracts had stronger antimicrobial activity compared to aqueous extracts [<xref rid=\"B28\" ref-type=\"bibr\">28</xref>]. The antifungal activity was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts; the highest concentration (600\u2009mg/ml) had the largest inhibition diameters while the lowest concentration (300\u2009mg/ml) had the smallest inhibition diameters. This could be explained by the fact that the high concentration contains a higher percentage of the bioactive compounds. This observation parallels findings in a study carried out by Mahmoud et al. [<xref rid=\"B29\" ref-type=\"bibr\">29</xref>] and Kiswii et al. [<xref rid=\"B4\" ref-type=\"bibr\">4</xref>]. Phytochemical screening indicated presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, and saponins in varying proportions in the plant extracts. The antifungal efficacy of plant extracts in this study could be associated with the bioactive compounds indicated by the phytochemical analysis. Organic fruit extracts of<italic> S. aculeastrum</italic> had the best antifungal activity against both strains of toxigenic<italic> A. flavus. Solanum aculeastrum</italic> in our study contained ten bioactive compounds which is 19.6% according to the phytochemical screening. These could be the possible cause of the antifungal activity.

The percentage of bioactive compounds (9.8%) in<italic> P. africana</italic> was the lowest and this could be attributed to the low antifungal activity by this extract. Organic extracts of<italic> P. africana</italic> against<italic> A. flavus</italic> UONV017 had higher antifungal activity at 450\u2009mg/ml than at 600\u2009mg/ml.

The control was comprised of no light and no photosensitizer treatment. However, nongerminated conidia treated with light and photosensitizer significantly reduced colony forming units (CFUs) by 40 and 70% with blue light of 80 and 100\u2009J/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, compared to control [<xref rid=\"B44\" ref-type=\"bibr\">44</xref>]. In another study, plant extracts that affect the central nervous system were tested for photoprotection and photosensitization.

The plants showed photo protection effect at low concentration and photosensitization effects at the higher concentrations [<xref rid=\"B45\" ref-type=\"bibr\">45</xref>]. This also parallels this study where the photosensitization effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the plant extracts.

Two ml of plant extract per one litre of the polluted water was exposed to the solar energy for one hour to allow complete inactivation of the coli forms [<xref rid=\"B46\" ref-type=\"bibr\">46</xref>].

In the study by [<xref rid=\"B19\" ref-type=\"bibr\">19</xref>], rate of spore knockout increased with the extract concentrations up to a certain level where the rate of spore knockout decreased with the highest concentration. This was attributed to the high fluid turbidity which may have caused reduced light penetration and transmission. In this study, therefore, the extract concentrations were at a suitable turbidity which did not cause much inhibition of light penetration and inhibition.</p>",
