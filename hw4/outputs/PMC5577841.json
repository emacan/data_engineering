        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">A unique clade of the bacterium <italic>Mycoplasma gallisepticum</italic> (MG), which causes chronic respiratory disease in poultry, has resulted in annual epidemics of conjunctivitis in North American house finches since the 1990s. Currently, few immunological tools have been validated for this songbird species. Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) is a prototypic multifunctional cytokine and can affect almost every cell type during <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> infection. The overall goal of this study was to develop and validate a direct ELISA assay for house finch IL-1\u03b2 (HfIL-1\u03b2) using a cross-reactive chicken antibody.</p>\n<p id=\"Par211\">A direct ELISA approach was used to develop this system using two different coating methods, carbonate and dehydration. In both methods, antigens (recombinant HfIL-1b or house finch plasma) were serially diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate coating buffer and either incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight or at 60 \u00b0C on a heating block for 2 hr. To generate the standard curve, rHfIL-1b protein was serially diluted at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 ng/mL. Following blocking and washing, anti-chicken IL-1b polyclonal antibody was added, plates were later incubated with detecting antibodies, and reactions developed with tetramethylbenzidine solution.</p>\n<p id=\"Par2\">A commercially available anti-chicken IL-1\u03b2 (ChIL-1\u03b2) polyclonal antibody (pAb) cross-reacted with house finch plasma IL-1\u03b2 as well as bacterially expressed recombinant house finch IL-1\u03b2 (rHfIL-1\u03b2) in immunoblotting assays. In a direct ELISA system, rHfIL-1\u03b2 could not be detected by an anti-ChIL-1\u03b2 pAb when the antigen was coated with carbonate-bicarbonate buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. However, rHfIL-1\u03b2 was detected by the anti-ChIL-1\u03b2 pAb when the antigen was coated using a dehydration method by heat (60\u00b0C). Using the developed direct ELISA for HfIL-1\u03b2 with commercial anti-ChIL-1\u03b2 pAb, we were able to measure plasma IL-1\u03b2 levels from house finches.</p>\n<p id=\"Par3\">Based on high amino acid sequence homology, we hypothesized and demonstrated cross-reactivity of anti-ChIL-1\u03b2 pAb and HfIL-1\u03b2. Then, we developed and validated a direct ELISA system for HfIL-1\u03b2 using a commercial anti-ChIL-1\u03b2 pAb by measuring plasma HfIL-1\u03b2 in house finches.</p>",
