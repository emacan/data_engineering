        "abstract": "<p><italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is increasingly recognised as a\nsignificant cause of sporadic and epidemic community-acquired and nosocomial\npneumonia. Many studies describe the frequency and severity of <italic>\nLegionella</italic> spp. contamination in spa pools, natural pools, hotels\nand ships, but there is no study analysing the environmental monitoring of <italic>\nLegionella</italic> on board trains. The aims of the present study were to\nconduct periodic and precise environmental surveillance of <italic>\nLegionella</italic> spp. in water systems and water tanks that supply the\ntoilet systems on trains, to assess the degree of contamination of such\nstructures and to determine the effectiveness of decontamination.</p>\n\n<p>A comparative pre-post ecological study was conducted from September 2006 to\nJanuary 2011. A total of 1,245 water samples were collected from plumbing\nand toilet water tanks on passenger trains. The prevalence proportion of all\npositive samples was calculated. The unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was\nperformed to evaluate statistically significant differences between the mean\nload values before and after the decontamination procedures; statistical\nsignificance was set at <italic>p</italic>\u2009\u2264\u20090.05.</p>\n\n<p>In the pre-decontamination period, 58% of the water samples were positive for <italic>\nLegionella</italic>. Only <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> was\nidentified: 55.84% were serogroup 1, 19.03% were serogroups 2\u201314 and\n25.13% contained both serogroups. The mean bacterial load value was\n2.14\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>3</sup>\u2009CFU/L. During the\npost-decontamination period, 42.75% of water samples were positive for <italic>\nLegionella</italic> spp.; 98.76% were positive for <italic>Legionella\npneumophila</italic>: 74.06% contained serogroup 1, 16.32% contained\nserogroups 2\u201314 and 9.62% contained both.
