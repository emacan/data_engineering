        "abstract": "<p id=\"Par1\">There are three main therapeutic strategies, namely expectant management (dilation and curettage only), prophylactic chemotherapy and prophylactic total hysterectomy for treating older women with complete hydatidiform mole (CHM). However, the scientific community has so far, not unanimously accepted the above-mentioned methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these therapeutic strategies in preventing post-molar gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) pertaining to patients with CHM who were at least 40\u00a0years old.</p>\n<p id=\"Par2\">Hundred and seventy-one patients from our hospital who had histologically been diagnosed of CHM and underwent treatment from January 2004 to December 2013 were included. All patients were followed continuously for a minimum of 2\u00a0years after which relevant clinical data were extracted and analysed.</p>\n<p id=\"Par3\">All patients were divided to three groups. Group 1 consisted of 124 patients, treated by expectant management, and the incidence of post-molar GTN was 37.1%. Group 2 included 12 patients who received prophylactic chemotherapy, with an incidence of 41.7%. The remaining 35 patients, Group 3, underwent prophylactic total hysterectomy, with the lowest incidence of 11.4%. A significantly lower incidence was noted in group 3 as compared to group 1 (<italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.004). GTN patients who received prophylactic chemotherapy required, on average, longer time to be diagnosed of GTN and had higher probability of chemotherapy resistance (<italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.031 and <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.024).</p>\n<p id=\"Par4\">This retrospective analysis showed that prophylactic total hysterectomy was the most effective therapeutic strategy for treating CHM in women at least 40\u00a0years old of age.</p>\n<p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12885-017-3749-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p>",

Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>].

However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",

Tow, Savage and Tsukmoto et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>] reported that women greater than 40\u00a0years old had a probability of 23-37% of developing persistent GTN after uterine evacuation, while the likelihood in women older than 50\u00a0years old was as high as 31-56%.

                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",

In our study, such clinical characteristics were evaluated and no significant differences were noted. We also investigated the clinical presentation of the study population; few were associated with toxemia, hyperthyroidism or coagulopathy, which is inconsistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. This phenomenon can be explained by the earlier diagnosis with the improvement of technology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>], especially the world-wide application of ultrasonography.

This phenomenon should alert physicians during clinical practice. Since older patients were easily neglected and misdiagnosed with amenorrhea due to the perimenopausal period around 40s, pregnancy might be suspected and abortion would be performed without pre-caution, exposing patients to uterine perforation and heavy bleeding. This study emphasizes on the fact that appropriate diagnostic attention should be given to older patients requesting for elective termination of pregnancy presenting with no complaints, and that, simultaneously, all products of conception after evacuation should be pathologically reviewed to exclude hydatidiform mole.</p>"

                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par30\">Another major finding of the current study is that prophylactic chemotherapy had a similar incidence of post-molar GTN as the expectant group. The use of prophylactic chemotherapy has been based on the assumption that the development of GTN is pre-determined, adding to the fact that metastatic GTN spreads via the bloodstream and that high serum level of cytotoxic agents around the time of evacuation should reduce the ability of the trophoblastic cells to invade or metastasize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. However, prophylactic chemotherapy exposed 80% of patients unnecessarily to toxic side effects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>] and might lead to incomplete protection against persistent tumour [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] reported a significant reduction in the rate of GTN transformation in adolescents and adults, while the targeted group was mostly below 40\u00a0years old, whether prophylactic chemotherapy could prevent post-molar GTN in women above 40\u00a0years old is still unclear. Our study was the first of its kind to study patients who were at least 40\u00a0years old and found that prophylactic chemotherapy could not reduce the incidence of post-molar GTN. In addition, we found that prophylactic chemotherapy increased time interval to GTN diagnosis and the incidence of chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it can be assumed that prophylactic chemotherapy delayed the diagnosis of GTN thus lead to chemotherapy resistance, which was also observed by a Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>]. It should be noted that the outcome of prophylactic chemotherapy in our study was based on the MTX 5-day regimen, therefore, it should be carefully interpreted as there are alternate regimens which may lead to better outcomes. Some may question the validity of our results as our study showed an opposite outcome in prophylactic chemotherapy compared to published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. However, the major difference between our study and RCTs is the target group, that is, we recruited patients who were being at least 40\u00a0years old with or without other high risk factors, which may lead to different results. Therefore, despite the fact that there is divergence, we strongly believe that the results of our study are reliable because we aimed at investigating an age specific group of patients who are 40\u00a0years old or above.</p>"

Tow, Savage and Tsukmoto et al.

                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par30\">Another major finding of the current study is that prophylactic chemotherapy had a similar incidence of post-molar GTN as the expectant group. The use of prophylactic chemotherapy has been based on the assumption that the development of GTN is pre-determined, adding to the fact that metastatic GTN spreads via the bloodstream and that high serum level of cytotoxic agents around the time of evacuation should reduce the ability of the trophoblastic cells to invade or metastasize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. However, prophylactic chemotherapy exposed 80% of patients unnecessarily to toxic side effects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>] and might lead to incomplete protection against persistent tumour [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] reported a significant reduction in the rate of GTN transformation in adolescents and adults, while the targeted group was mostly below 40\u00a0years old, whether prophylactic chemotherapy could prevent post-molar GTN in women above 40\u00a0years old is still unclear. Our study was the first of its kind to study patients who were at least 40\u00a0years old and found that prophylactic chemotherapy could not reduce the incidence of post-molar GTN. In addition, we found that prophylactic chemotherapy increased time interval to GTN diagnosis and the incidence of chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it can be assumed that prophylactic chemotherapy delayed the diagnosis of GTN thus lead to chemotherapy resistance, which was also observed by a Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>]. It should be noted that the outcome of prophylactic chemotherapy in our study was based on the MTX 5-day regimen, therefore, it should be carefully interpreted as there are alternate regimens which may lead to better outcomes. Some may question the validity of our results as our study showed an opposite outcome in prophylactic chemotherapy compared to published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. However, the major difference between our study and RCTs is the target group, that is, we recruited patients who were being at least 40\u00a0years old with or without other high risk factors, which may lead to different results. Therefore, despite the fact that there is divergence, we strongly believe that the results of our study are reliable because we aimed at investigating an age specific group of patients who are 40\u00a0years old or above.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par35\">We conclude that prophylactic total hysterectomy is beneficial in patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. This study therefore, proposes total hysterectomy be considered as the optimal treatment option for women over 40 who have completed their family. This is because it appears to significantly reduce the risk of subsequent GTN compared to expectant management. However, further larger studies are required to substantiate our finding. Finally, in agreement with prior work, our data do not support the use of prophylactic chemotherapy.</p>",

                            "<p id=\"Par28\">D &amp; C is the preferred treatment option for young patients with CHM, while for older patients who are at least 40\u00a0years old and no longer require fertility, total hysterectomy or prophylactic chemotherapy might be considered due to the higher incidence of post-molar GTN. However, there is no general consensus on the two above-mentioned therapeutic strategies. It can be stated that each method has its advantages and disadvantages. The objective in managing CHM lies in preventing post-molar GTN which subsequently leads to metastasis. Therefore, any therapeutic strategy should be weighed on the basis of prevention. Consequently, the present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the three main therapeutic strategies based on the incidence of post-molar GTN.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par30\">Another major finding of the current study is that prophylactic chemotherapy had a similar incidence of post-molar GTN as the expectant group. The use of prophylactic chemotherapy has been based on the assumption that the development of GTN is pre-determined, adding to the fact that metastatic GTN spreads via the bloodstream and that high serum level of cytotoxic agents around the time of evacuation should reduce the ability of the trophoblastic cells to invade or metastasize [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. However, prophylactic chemotherapy exposed 80% of patients unnecessarily to toxic side effects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>] and might lead to incomplete protection against persistent tumour [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>] reported a significant reduction in the rate of GTN transformation in adolescents and adults, while the targeted group was mostly below 40\u00a0years old, whether prophylactic chemotherapy could prevent post-molar GTN in women above 40\u00a0years old is still unclear. Our study was the first of its kind to study patients who were at least 40\u00a0years old and found that prophylactic chemotherapy could not reduce the incidence of post-molar GTN. In addition, we found that prophylactic chemotherapy increased time interval to GTN diagnosis and the incidence of chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, it can be assumed that prophylactic chemotherapy delayed the diagnosis of GTN thus lead to chemotherapy resistance, which was also observed by a Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR27\">27</xref>]. It should be noted that the outcome of prophylactic chemotherapy in our study was based on the MTX 5-day regimen, therefore, it should be carefully interpreted as there are alternate regimens which may lead to better outcomes. Some may question the validity of our results as our study showed an opposite outcome in prophylactic chemotherapy compared to published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. However, the major difference between our study and RCTs is the target group, that is, we recruited patients who were being at least 40\u00a0years old with or without other high risk factors, which may lead to different results. Therefore, despite the fact that there is divergence, we strongly believe that the results of our study are reliable because we aimed at investigating an age specific group of patients who are 40\u00a0years old or above.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par31\">Maternal age, gestational age, hCG level prior to evacuation greater than 100,000\u00a0IU/L, uterine enlargement, a theca lutein cyst greater than 6\u00a0cm have been frequently reported to be associated with GTN. In our study, such clinical characteristics were evaluated and no significant differences were noted. We also investigated the clinical presentation of the study population; few were associated with toxemia, hyperthyroidism or coagulopathy, which is inconsistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. This phenomenon can be explained by the earlier diagnosis with the improvement of technology [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>], especially the world-wide application of ultrasonography. As in our study, 94.2% of the patients were diagnosed in the first trimester when the symptoms of toxemia, hyperthyroidism or coagulopathy are usually rare.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par32\">The most common clinical manifestation was abnormal vaginal bleeding, a few accompanied with abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, which is consistent with the clinical manifestations of young patients. Interestingly, 8.6% of patients in our study presented with amenorrhea as the only symptom, compared to just 0.8% in young patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>], hinting a major difference in presentation. This phenomenon should alert physicians during clinical practice. Since older patients were easily neglected and misdiagnosed with amenorrhea due to the perimenopausal period around 40s, pregnancy might be suspected and abortion would be performed without pre-caution, exposing patients to uterine perforation and heavy bleeding. This study emphasizes on the fact that appropriate diagnostic attention should be given to older patients requesting for elective termination of pregnancy presenting with no complaints, and that, simultaneously, all products of conception after evacuation should be pathologically reviewed to exclude hydatidiform mole.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par34\">The strengths of our study are that, compared to previous studies, we recruited larger size of patients, used explicit criteria and improved the study design. In the light of our knowledge, it is one of the largest retrospective cohorts reported in literature pertaining to women with complete hydatidiform mole who are at least 40\u00a0years old.</p>",
                            "<p id=\"Par35\">We conclude that prophylactic total hysterectomy is beneficial in patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. This study therefore, proposes total hysterectomy be considered as the optimal treatment option for women over 40 who have completed their family. This is because it appears to significantly reduce the risk of subsequent GTN compared to expectant management. However, further larger studies are required to substantiate our finding. Finally, in agreement with prior work, our data do not support the use of prophylactic chemotherapy.</p>",

                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN.

                            "<p id=\"Par29\">This study predominantly shows that prophylactic total hysterectomy significantly decreased the incidence of post-molar GTN, indicating that total hysterectomy might be the best therapeutic strategy for older patients who had completed childbearing. Hysterectomy was first introduced in 1966 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>]. Since then, concerns have been raised upon the potential vascular dissemination of trophoblastic tissue due to the surgical procedure involved [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Meanwhile, the liberal use of hysterectomy in the elderly and multiparous patients has also been favoured [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR20\">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. Several authors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>] claimed a 10-20% chance of malignancy in hysterectomy group compared to 33.3% of non-hysterectomy group. However, considering the above mentioned studies including patients across all ages and selecting both types of hydatidiform mole, the results are not applicable to older patients with CHM who are at least 40\u00a0years old. Sporadic study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>] aimed for this age-specific group of patients showed that hysterectomy might result in a better outcome, however, due to the marginal number of patients receiving hysterectomy (only 6 patients), the clinical significance is highly doubted. In comparison, our study consisted of 37 patients in the prophylactic hysterectomy group, which theoretically should lead to more reliable results. It is worth mentioning that a recent study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>] showed that hysterectomy after 40\u00a0years old in women with HM does not reduce the incidence of GTN. In this study, a total of 76 patients with HM who were over 40\u00a0years old were included. The incidence of post-molar GTN were 58.3 and 29.7%, respectively (total hysterectomy versus uterine evacuation, <italic>P</italic>\u00a0=\u00a00.094). The authors concluded that primary hysterectomy might not be able to prevent post-molar GTN. However, they included patients who were diagnosed with invasive HM in the total hysterectomy group, which could increase the probability of post-molar GTN. We deemed that this selection bias could seriously weaken the confidence of the results and lead to incorrect conclusion.</p>",
