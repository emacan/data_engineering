We investigated the potentials of usage of FET-PET/CT in addition to MRI for definition of gross tumor volume (GTV) in stereotactic radiotherapy of lesions of skull base.</p>\n<p>We included in a prospective setting 21 cases. An MRI was performed, completed by FET PET/CT. Different GTV\u2019s were defined based on respective imaging tools: 1. GTVMRI, 2. GTV MRI /CT, 3. GTV composit (1 + 2), and GTVPET = GTV Boost. Lesions could be visualised by MRI and FET-PET/CT in all patients.</p>\n<p>FET tracer enhancement was found in all cases. Skull base infiltration by these lesions was observed by MRI, CT (PET/CT) and FET-PET (PET/CT) in all patients. Totally, brain tissue infiltration was seen in 10 patients. While, in 7 (out 10) cases, MRI and CT (from PET/CT) were indicating brain infiltration, FET-PET could add additional information regarding infiltrative behaviour: in 3 (out 10) patients, infiltration of the brain was displayed merely in FET-PET. An enlargement of GTVMRI/CT due to the FET-PET driven information, which revealed GTVcomposite , was necessary in 7 cases,. This enlargement was significant by definition (&gt; 10% of GTVMRI/CT). The mean PET-effect on GTV counted for 1 \u00b1 4 cm3. The restricted boost fields were based mainly on the GTVPET volume. In mean, about 8.5 cm3 of GTVMRI/CT, which showed no FET uptake, were excluded from target volume. GTVboost driven by only-PET-activity, was in mean by 33% smaller than the initial large treatment field, GTVcomposite, for those cases received boost treatment. FET-PET lead to significant (&gt;10%) changes in the initial treatment fields in 11/21 patients and showed additional tumour volume relevant for radiation planning in 6/21 cases, and led to a subsequent decrease of more than 10% of the initial volumes for the boost fields.</p>\n<p>The implementation of FET PET into the planning procedures showed a benefit in terms of accurate definition of skull base lesions as targets for Image-guided stereotactic Radiotherapy. This has to be investigated prospectively in larger cohorts.</p>",

The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

A variety of sophisticated, high-tech systems are available, including linac-based SRS and robotic SRS. A large body of valid data is available to date [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. International practice guidelines have already implemented SRS and FSRT into their catalogue of recommendations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>].</p>",

Because of the relative opacity of the cranial vault and complex anatomic structures, the accuracy of target definition relies on the quality of available imaging technologies. The need for the best possible and most accurate anatomic visualisation is magnified by the high ablative doses delivered using SRS or FSRT. The main goal of SRS has been the deployment of a high ablative dose made possible by maximal spatial accuracy.</p>",
                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>].

                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point.

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality.

                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al.

A variety of sophisticated, high-tech systems are available, including linac-based SRS and robotic SRS. A large body of valid data is available to date [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

We performed delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) on contrast-enhanced T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images of 21 patients. We defined the GTV<sub>MRI</sub> and expanded it into areas showing signs of erosion in adjacent bone from the CT component of the PET/CT, creating the composite volume GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub>. Thereafter, the radiation oncologists were blinded to the generated contours. The volume GTV<sub>PET</sub> was defined only in areas with FET-tracer enhancement based on qualitative criteria. For the delineation of GTV<sub>PET</sub>, we performed the same procedure as employed by Astner et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to reach an alignment of the PET and MRI data. We formed GTV<sub>composite</sub> based on MRI/CT data, and enlarged it to include the PET avid areas because of the high specificity of the FET tracer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This GTV<sub>composite</sub> was determined for the initial larger radiation fields. For these fields, we did not exclude non-enhancing areas with tumour criteria from MRI because of the reported low sensitivity of FET [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>].

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] by defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to align the PET and MR imaging of the tumour to the normal brain interface. However, this method has been criticised to be subjective to a certain extent.</p>",
                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min.

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy.

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base.

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point.

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality.

Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

Totally, brain tissue infiltration was seen in 10 patients. While, in 7 (out 10) cases, MRI and CT (from PET/CT) were indicating brain infiltration, FET-PET could add additional information regarding infiltrative behaviour: in 3 (out 10) patients, infiltration of the brain was displayed merely in FET-PET. An enlargement of GTVMRI/CT due to the FET-PET driven information, which revealed GTVcomposite , was necessary in 7 cases,. This enlargement was significant by definition (&gt; 10% of GTVMRI/CT). The mean PET-effect on GTV counted for 1 \u00b1 4 cm3. The restricted boost fields were based mainly on the GTVPET volume. In mean, about 8.5 cm3 of GTVMRI/CT, which showed no FET uptake, were excluded from target volume. GTVboost driven by only-PET-activity, was in mean by 33% smaller than the initial large treatment field, GTVcomposite, for those cases received boost treatment. FET-PET lead to significant (&gt;10%) changes in the initial treatment fields in 11/21 patients and showed additional tumour volume relevant for radiation planning in 6/21 cases, and led to a subsequent decrease of more than 10% of the initial volumes for the boost fields.</p>",

However, this method has been criticised to be subjective to a certain extent.</p>",
                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",
                            "<p>For extracranial tumours, there are no valid data comparing MRI and FET-PET/CT. Although research presented by the German group of Neuner et al. showed that the juxtaposition of PET and MRI may provide new opportunities for clinical purposes. They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min. The hybrid modality approach provides information from different methods while using the same isocentre, resulting in sufficient spatial orientation and temporal realignment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Data are available for the comparison of FET-PET with FDG-PET in patients with head and neck tumours. Balogova et al.

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] confirmed the lower sensitivity of FET-PET (75% versus 93%) and reported a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) in comparison to FDG-PET.

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al.

A variety of sophisticated, high-tech systems are available, including linac-based SRS and robotic SRS. A large body of valid data is available to date [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min. The hybrid modality approach provides information from different methods while using the same isocentre, resulting in sufficient spatial orientation and temporal realignment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>].

Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al.

GTVMRI, 2. GTV MRI /CT, 3. GTV composit (1 + 2), and GTVPET = GTV Boost. Lesions could be visualised by MRI and FET-PET/CT in all patients.</p>",
                            "<p>FET tracer enhancement was found in all cases. Skull base infiltration by these lesions was observed by MRI, CT (PET/CT) and FET-PET (PET/CT) in all patients. Totally, brain tissue infiltration was seen in 10 patients. While, in 7 (out 10) cases, MRI and CT (from PET/CT) were indicating brain infiltration, FET-PET could add additional information regarding infiltrative behaviour: in 3 (out 10) patients, infiltration of the brain was displayed merely in FET-PET. An enlargement of GTVMRI/CT due to the FET-PET driven information, which revealed GTVcomposite , was necessary in 7 cases,. This enlargement was significant by definition (&gt; 10% of GTVMRI/CT). The mean PET-effect on GTV counted for 1 \u00b1 4 cm3. The restricted boost fields were based mainly on the GTVPET volume. In mean, about 8.5 cm3 of GTVMRI/CT, which showed no FET uptake, were excluded from target volume. GTVboost driven by only-PET-activity, was in mean by 33% smaller than the initial large treatment field, GTVcomposite, for those cases received boost treatment. FET-PET lead to significant (&gt;10%) changes in the initial treatment fields in 11/21 patients and showed additional tumour volume relevant for radiation planning in 6/21 cases, and led to a subsequent decrease of more than 10% of the initial volumes for the boost fields.</p>",

                            "<p>Stereotactic image-guided methods including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) are part of a powerful arsenal for disease control in patients with benign and malignant cranial lesions. A variety of sophisticated, high-tech systems are available, including linac-based SRS and robotic SRS. A large body of valid data is available to date [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. International practice guidelines have already implemented SRS and FSRT into their catalogue of recommendations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Radiosurgery refers to the precise delivery of an ablative dose in 1 to 5 fractions to a focal target. Because of the relative opacity of the cranial vault and complex anatomic structures, the accuracy of target definition relies on the quality of available imaging technologies. The need for the best possible and most accurate anatomic visualisation is magnified by the high ablative doses delivered using SRS or FSRT. The main goal of SRS has been the deployment of a high ablative dose made possible by maximal spatial accuracy.</p>",
                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>It is an urgent scientific question to determine if geometrical and spatial inaccuracies in SRS and FSRT are the result of delineation errors during treatment planning. This is especially important if the errors lead to avoidable geographic misses, resulting in unnecessary enlargement of the volume, thus increasing the frequency of severe morbidity. In this study neither specifics of histology nor clinical outcome was from primary interest, we intended to investigate the role of FET-PET/CT for a series of 21 patients with tumors infiltrating skull base.

We performed delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) on contrast-enhanced T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images of 21 patients.

                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>).

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] by defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to align the PET and MR imaging of the tumour to the normal brain interface. However, this method has been criticised to be subjective to a certain extent.</p>",
                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

Although research presented by the German group of Neuner et al. showed that the juxtaposition of PET and MRI may provide new opportunities for clinical purposes. They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min. The hybrid modality approach provides information from different methods while using the same isocentre, resulting in sufficient spatial orientation and temporal realignment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",

Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",

The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality.

Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality.

Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al.

Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to reach an alignment of the PET and MRI data. We formed GTV<sub>composite</sub> based on MRI/CT data, and enlarged it to include the PET avid areas because of the high specificity of the FET tracer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This GTV<sub>composite</sub> was determined for the initial larger radiation fields. For these fields, we did not exclude non-enhancing areas with tumour criteria from MRI because of the reported low sensitivity of FET [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. We simulated the generation of GTV<sub>boost</sub> for the additional radiation dose based on GTV<sub>PET</sub>, assuming high tumour cell density [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and/or high proliferative activity. Significant parts of GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub> that showed hyperintensity but not enhancing tracer were excluded from the high-dose volume and were assumed to represent fibrosis, necrosis, or scarring after surgery and/or radiotherapy with reduced cell count based on investigator\u2019s experience, clinical information and available data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. The data were evaluated on a lesional basis with the objective to compare the results of the GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub> with GTV<sub>composite</sub> changed according to the PET information, and with the limited GTV<sub>boost</sub>. Changes to the conventional GTV or composite GTV\u2009&gt;\u200910% were defined as significant and considered relevant for radiation planning (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).</p>",

However, this method has been criticised to be subjective to a certain extent.</p>",
                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",
                            "<p>For extracranial tumours, there are no valid data comparing MRI and FET-PET/CT. Although research presented by the German group of Neuner et al. showed that the juxtaposition of PET and MRI may provide new opportunities for clinical purposes. They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min. The hybrid modality approach provides information from different methods while using the same isocentre, resulting in sufficient spatial orientation and temporal realignment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Data are available for the comparison of FET-PET with FDG-PET in patients with head and neck tumours. Balogova et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] reported on the greater sensitivity of FDG-PET and better specificity of FET-PET. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] confirmed the lower sensitivity of FET-PET (75% versus 93%) and reported a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) in comparison to FDG-PET. In a similar approach, Haerle et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] reported a sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET of 89% and 50%, respectively, as opposed to 70% and 90% for FET-PET.

                            "<p>Radiotherapy planning procedures may gain a higher degree of certainty by using FET-PET/CT in order to improve the definition of the boost, assuming that high SUV values represent volumes with high cell density [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].

GTVMRI, 2. GTV MRI /CT, 3. GTV composit (1 + 2), and GTVPET = GTV Boost. Lesions could be visualised by MRI and FET-PET/CT in all patients.</p>",
                            "<p>FET tracer enhancement was found in all cases. Skull base infiltration by these lesions was observed by MRI, CT (PET/CT) and FET-PET (PET/CT) in all patients. Totally, brain tissue infiltration was seen in 10 patients. While, in 7 (out 10) cases, MRI and CT (from PET/CT) were indicating brain infiltration, FET-PET could add additional information regarding infiltrative behaviour: in 3 (out 10) patients, infiltration of the brain was displayed merely in FET-PET. An enlargement of GTVMRI/CT due to the FET-PET driven information, which revealed GTVcomposite , was necessary in 7 cases,. This enlargement was significant by definition (&gt; 10% of GTVMRI/CT). The mean PET-effect on GTV counted for 1 \u00b1 4 cm3. The restricted boost fields were based mainly on the GTVPET volume. In mean, about 8.5 cm3 of GTVMRI/CT, which showed no FET uptake, were excluded from target volume. GTVboost driven by only-PET-activity, was in mean by 33% smaller than the initial large treatment field, GTVcomposite, for those cases received boost treatment. FET-PET lead to significant (&gt;10%) changes in the initial treatment fields in 11/21 patients and showed additional tumour volume relevant for radiation planning in 6/21 cases, and led to a subsequent decrease of more than 10% of the initial volumes for the boost fields.</p>",
                            "<p>Stereotactic image-guided methods including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) are part of a powerful arsenal for disease control in patients with benign and malignant cranial lesions. A variety of sophisticated, high-tech systems are available, including linac-based SRS and robotic SRS. A large body of valid data is available to date [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. International practice guidelines have already implemented SRS and FSRT into their catalogue of recommendations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Radiosurgery refers to the precise delivery of an ablative dose in 1 to 5 fractions to a focal target. Because of the relative opacity of the cranial vault and complex anatomic structures, the accuracy of target definition relies on the quality of available imaging technologies. The need for the best possible and most accurate anatomic visualisation is magnified by the high ablative doses delivered using SRS or FSRT. The main goal of SRS has been the deployment of a high ablative dose made possible by maximal spatial accuracy.</p>",
                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>It is an urgent scientific question to determine if geometrical and spatial inaccuracies in SRS and FSRT are the result of delineation errors during treatment planning. This is especially important if the errors lead to avoidable geographic misses, resulting in unnecessary enlargement of the volume, thus increasing the frequency of severe morbidity. In this study neither specifics of histology nor clinical outcome was from primary interest, we intended to investigate the role of FET-PET/CT for a series of 21 patients with tumors infiltrating skull base. We intended to assess whether integration of FET PET/CT into radiotherapy planning influences treatment field selection based on discordant findings compared to CT and MRI.</p>",

This study has been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. After receiving institutional review board approval and the informed consent of the patients, we initiated the analysis. All patients underwent MRI and FET-PET/CT (with contrast-enhanced CT) under similar and standardised conditions regarding preparation and positioning. Patient characteristics are presented in Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>.</p>",
                            "<p>As shown, a major portion of the patients presented with squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating the skull base (13/21), while the other 8 patients had other pathologies. Eleven (11/21) had prior RT.</p>",
                            "<p>PET data were obtained in 3-dimensional (3D) mode using a hybrid PET/CT system consisting of a multislice CT and a full-ring PET scanner (Biograph 16\u2122, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A low-protein was prescribed for 8\u00a0h prior to the PET examination. The patients were placed in a dedicated positioning device for the head with an additional cushion and bandages for fixation. A contrast media-enhanced (100\u00a0mL Ultravist 370 Schering, Berlin, Germany) CT scan (detector collimation, 16\u2009\u00d7\u20091.5\u00a0mm; tube current, 100\u00a0mA; tube voltage, 120\u00a0kV; gantry rotation time 0.8\u00a0s) covering the entire head was performed for attenuation correction. PET was acquired in a single bed position with a 16\u00a0cm axial field of view (FOV) with the middle of the FOV at the base of the skull. Emission scanning started 10\u00a0min after intravenous administration of 200\u00a0MBq <sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET (acquisition time, 20\u00a0min). PET emission data were reconstructed iteratively using an ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) algorithm with a matrix size of 128\u2009\u00d7\u2009128.</p>",

Regularly, magnetisation-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) T<sub>1</sub>-weighted sequences were used for co-registration after intravenous administration of Gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist\u2122, Schering A G, Berlin, Germany) at a dosage of 0.1\u00a0mmol/kg of body weight). 140 These 3D volume datasets in 1- to 1.5-mm slice thicknesses offer high spatial resolution and allow for coronal and sagittal reformations, enabling contouring in orthogonal planes.</p>",

Radiotherapy was usually administered at a fractionation of 5\u2009\u00d7\u20092.0 Gray (Gy) until a dose of 60\u00a0Gy was obtained for the initial (large field) treatment, followed by additional doses at a reduced (boost) volume, in the range of 10 to 12\u00a0Gy at the reference point [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The segmentations were complemented by definitions used by Grosu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], and are illustrated in Figure\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>. We performed delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) on contrast-enhanced T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images of 21 patients. We defined the GTV<sub>MRI</sub> and expanded it into areas showing signs of erosion in adjacent bone from the CT component of the PET/CT, creating the composite volume GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub>. Thereafter, the radiation oncologists were blinded to the generated contours. The volume GTV<sub>PET</sub> was defined only in areas with FET-tracer enhancement based on qualitative criteria. For the delineation of GTV<sub>PET</sub>, we performed the same procedure as employed by Astner et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to reach an alignment of the PET and MRI data. We formed GTV<sub>composite</sub> based on MRI/CT data, and enlarged it to include the PET avid areas because of the high specificity of the FET tracer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This GTV<sub>composite</sub> was determined for the initial larger radiation fields. For these fields, we did not exclude non-enhancing areas with tumour criteria from MRI because of the reported low sensitivity of FET [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. We simulated the generation of GTV<sub>boost</sub> for the additional radiation dose based on GTV<sub>PET</sub>, assuming high tumour cell density [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>] and/or high proliferative activity. Significant parts of GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub> that showed hyperintensity but not enhancing tracer were excluded from the high-dose volume and were assumed to represent fibrosis, necrosis, or scarring after surgery and/or radiotherapy with reduced cell count based on investigator\u2019s experience, clinical information and available data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. The data were evaluated on a lesional basis with the objective to compare the results of the GTV<sub>MRI/CT</sub> with GTV<sub>composite</sub> changed according to the PET information, and with the limited GTV<sub>boost</sub>. Changes to the conventional GTV or composite GTV\u2009&gt;\u200910% were defined as significant and considered relevant for radiation planning (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).</p>",

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] by defining tumour borders by adapting the windowing to align the PET and MR imaging of the tumour to the normal brain interface. However, this method has been criticised to be subjective to a certain extent.</p>",
                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. In our analysis, the FET-PET data were acquired 10 to 30\u00a0min after the injection of FET, which was similar to the study done by Grosu and Weber [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>], where FET-PET was acquired 20\u201340\u00a0min after tracer injection. These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",
                            "<p>For extracranial tumours, there are no valid data comparing MRI and FET-PET/CT. Although research presented by the German group of Neuner et al. showed that the juxtaposition of PET and MRI may provide new opportunities for clinical purposes. They stated that the new technologies comprising MR-PET hybrid systems have the advantage of providing clinical solutions with a single procedure lasting 45\u00a0min. The hybrid modality approach provides information from different methods while using the same isocentre, resulting in sufficient spatial orientation and temporal realignment [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Data are available for the comparison of FET-PET with FDG-PET in patients with head and neck tumours. Balogova et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] reported on the greater sensitivity of FDG-PET and better specificity of FET-PET. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] confirmed the lower sensitivity of FET-PET (75% versus 93%) and reported a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) in comparison to FDG-PET. In a similar approach, Haerle et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>] reported a sensitivity and specificity for FDG-PET of 89% and 50%, respectively, as opposed to 70% and 90% for FET-PET.

                            "<p>Radiotherapy planning procedures may gain a higher degree of certainty by using FET-PET/CT in order to improve the definition of the boost, assuming that high SUV values represent volumes with high cell density [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].

Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality.

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy.

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

We performed delineation of the gross tumour volume (GTV) on contrast-enhanced T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MRI images of 21 patients.

                            "<p>Nevertheless, in regard to the originality of the questions examined in this study, there are many issues to be discussed. While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",
                            "<p>While we performed a pilot study of the medical and technical feasibility of the implementation of FET-PET/CT into RT planning, it is important to discuss issues related to logistics. The time interval of the PET scanning after FET injection is one point. Malignant tumours, e.g. glioblastomas, exhibit an early peak of FET uptake after 15\u201320\u00a0min, which is followed by a decreasing time activity curve [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

These two studies were able to demonstrate an enhancement of brain metastases of various pathologies, confirming our findings of FET enhancement within histologically different tumours (Table\u00a0<xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). Therefore, some of the lesions in other studies may have been rated as negative in later scans, although the lesion might have been positive in early scans. Pauleit et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>] could not detect the uptake of FET in the majority of extracranial tumours apart from squamous cell carcinomas, when scans were started 1\u00a0h after injection of FET.</p>",

                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy.

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy.

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET.

                            "<p>FET tracer enhancement was found in all cases. Skull base infiltration by these lesions was observed by MRI, CT (PET/CT) and FET-PET (PET/CT) in all patients. Totally, brain tissue infiltration was seen in 10 patients. While, in 7 (out 10) cases, MRI and CT (from PET/CT) were indicating brain infiltration, FET-PET could add additional information regarding infiltrative behaviour: in 3 (out 10) patients, infiltration of the brain was displayed merely in FET-PET. An enlargement of GTVMRI/CT due to the FET-PET driven information, which revealed GTVcomposite , was necessary in 7 cases,. This enlargement was significant by definition (&gt; 10% of GTVMRI/CT). The mean PET-effect on GTV counted for 1 \u00b1 4 cm3. The restricted boost fields were based mainly on the GTVPET volume. In mean, about 8.5 cm3 of GTVMRI/CT, which showed no FET uptake, were excluded from target volume. GTVboost driven by only-PET-activity, was in mean by 33% smaller than the initial large treatment field, GTVcomposite, for those cases received boost treatment. FET-PET lead to significant (&gt;10%) changes in the initial treatment fields in 11/21 patients and showed additional tumour volume relevant for radiation planning in 6/21 cases, and led to a subsequent decrease of more than 10% of the initial volumes for the boost fields.</p>",
                            "<p>The evolution of digital image media technologies started with the inception of computed tomography (CT) in the 1970s, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s. As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>]. Much research work has been conducted in order to investigate the potential of FET-PET for diagnostic examinations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. FET has a lower sensitivity (75% versus 93%) but a substantially higher specificity (95% versus 79%) for detecting tumours compared with FDG. A strong correlation between cellular density and the standardised uptake value (SUV) of FET has been demonstrated by various groups [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>]. Amino acid accumulation information provides the ability to apply heterogonous dose regimens, and therefore, to boost the dose to partial hyperactive volumes within a tumour after an initial large volume is irradiated [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy. For brain metastases of solid tumours, the correlation between real tumour extension and the imaging from MRI or CT is very high [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET. There were positive findings on MRI that were negative on FDG-PET/CT, and negative on MRI with positive findings on FDG-PET/CT for infiltration of bony structures in 10 (9%) and 8 (7.2%) patients, and for intracranial extension in 15 patients (13.5%) and 1 patient (0.9%).</p>",

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio.

As a result, imaging has made a much larger impact on treatment modalities for cranial lesions. Based on complex nuclear interactions, MRI has been subject of many sources of error: spatial distortions, resonance offset, and the absence of electron density information. These brief remarks on the basic details of CT and MRI illustrate the conceptual distinctions between geometric (CT) and diagnostic (MRI) accuracy. Mathematical algorithms have been developed to utilise the best and most useful information from each modality through manual integration, semi-automated superposition, and later with automatic co-registration. Positron emission tomography (PET) has also played a crucial role as a cranial imaging modality. The detection of preferential accumulation of positron-emitting radioactive tracers seems to be a major additional benefit for image-guided procedures in different fields [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. Since fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) (FDG) seems not to be appropriate for brain lesions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], new tracer compounds like amino acids may impact the therapeutic ratio. The newly introduced tracer O-(2-(<sup>18</sup>\u2009F) fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (<sup>18</sup>\u2009F-FET) allows a more precise estimation of cranial tumour borders than MRI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>].

While planning radiotherapy for tumours of skull base, an MRI is performed in addition to the planning CT. Both methods show anatomical structures of the brain with high accuracy.

However, the correlation between tumour extension and the radiologic imaging of the malignant tissue is rather different for lesions extending from nasopharyngeal space into the skull base. Compared to FET-PET, FDG-PET might have less validity if one considers the well-known high glucose metabolism of the brain. Ng et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>] showed data in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas that were discordant when comparing MRI with FDG-PET.
