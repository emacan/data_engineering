        "abstract": "<p>Medical co-morbidity may be associated with impaired cognitive function based on prior studies. However, no studies to date have determined to what extent this association is linked to medical illness or other factors that may be linked to medical illness (such as education, income levels, depression or subjective memory loss). The present study examined how medical co-morbidity, socioeconomic status (defined as residential SES), education and depression are associated with subjective and objective memory function in a sample of patients recruited from a university affiliated Memory Disorders Clinic located in a large Canadian inner city teaching hospital.</p>\n<p>Data was collected from 85 consecutive referrals to an Inner City Memory Disorders Clinic including socio-demographic characteristics, cognitive status and medical co-morbidity. Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted.</p>\n<p>Impaired objective cognitive function correlated significantly with increased medical co-morbidity and partially with education but not with residential SES or depression. Elevated memory complaints correlated significantly with depression, inversely with residential SES and not at all with medical co-morbidity or education.</p>\n<p>Increased medical co-morbidity is significantly associated with impaired cognitive performance but not with subjective memory complaints in an Inner City Memory Clinic sample.</p>",

Given that age may be a covariate or suppressor variable in the analyses, we reran the spearman rank correlations analyses with age as a co-variate and the results were similar except for a small change in the magnitude of the observed associations. In addition, we conducted multivariable linear regression to examine whether depression or subjective memory complaints are associated with objective memory/cognitive performance after the effects of medical co-morbidity are removed. We found no significant associations. We felt that it was important to run these additional analyses to ensure that the observed association between medical co-morbidity and objective memory impairment was not being driven by other confounders such as age, depression or subjective memory loss.</p>"

There are many reasons for this. For example, age is a risk factor for many common diseases such as diabetes and chronic obstructive lung disease. According to previous research, medical co-morbidity rates tend to be higher among patients living in large urban centres, often due to low socioeconomic status and poorer access to health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. High rates of medical co-morbidity have also been found to be associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including impaired function in activities of daily living, increased utilization of acute care services, and increased mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. The question of the impact of medical co-morbidity on cognitive function is a complex one. It is generally known that having multiple medical disorders may be associated with impaired brain function, partly due to the direct neurotoxic effects of disease on the brain and partly due to the possible neurotoxic effects of medications used to treat these diseases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Patients with low SES may be particularly at risk [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>].

There are many reasons for this. For example, age is a risk factor for many common diseases such as diabetes and chronic obstructive lung disease. According to previous research, medical co-morbidity rates tend to be higher among patients living in large urban centres, often due to low socioeconomic status and poorer access to health services [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. High rates of medical co-morbidity have also been found to be associated with a number of adverse outcomes, including impaired function in activities of daily living, increased utilization of acute care services, and increased mortality [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. The question of the impact of medical co-morbidity on cognitive function is a complex one.

Mariani et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] examined a sample of patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) and discovered cognitive functioning was a strong predictor of IADL performance while co-morbidity was not, possibly due to the fact that traditionally changes in ADL performance are more strongly linked to medical co-morbidity. Salvi et al [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>] examined a cohort of acutely ill medical inpatients and found a strong correlation between medical co-morbidity, cognitive functioning, length of stay, depression and disability.

Conversely there was no correlation between medical co-morbidity and subjective memory complaints as measured by the PAOF (p &gt; .05). Furthermore, there was no correlation with any of the PAOF sub scores (p &gt; .05). Education correlated, as predicted, with cognition as measured by the MMSE (p &lt; .05), but surprisingly not with the BNA or any of the sub scores. Residential SES correlated negatively with overall subjective memory complaints (p &lt; .001), and with two sub scores, (memory complaints (p &lt; .001) and language complaints (p &lt; .01)) while it correlated positively with executive function (p &lt; .01). Depression did not correlate significantly with any measure of objective cognitive function (p &gt; .05) but positively with overall subjective general complaints (p &lt; .001), memory complaints (p &lt; .001) and language complaints (p &lt; .05) with the exception of complaints in motor function (p &gt; .05). Given that age may be a covariate or suppressor variable in the analyses, we reran the spearman rank correlations analyses with age as a co-variate and the results were similar except for a small change in the magnitude of the observed associations. In addition, we conducted multivariable linear regression to examine whether depression or subjective memory complaints are associated with objective memory/cognitive performance after the effects of medical co-morbidity are removed. We found no significant associations. We felt that it was important to run these additional analyses to ensure that the observed association between medical co-morbidity and objective memory impairment was not being driven by other confounders such as age, depression or subjective memory loss.</p>",
