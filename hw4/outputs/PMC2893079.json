        "abstract": "<p>High fat diets have long been associated with weight gain and obesity, and the weak satiety response elicited in response to dietary lipids is likely to play a role. Suppression of appetite and food intake has consistently been shown to be diminished with high fat relative to either high protein or carbohydrate meals. There is however some evidence that the satiating capacity of lipids may be modulated when physicochemical properties are altered, but studies investigating the effect of lipid saturation on appetite have generated inconsistent findings. This study investigated the effects of changes in fatty acid saturation on post-ingestive satiety and energy intake.</p>\n<p>High-fat (HF) test breakfasts (2.0 MJ) containing 26 g lipid were given to 18 healthy, lean men in a 3 treatment randomised cross-over design, each treatment separated by a washout of at least 3 days. The breakfasts were high in saturated (SFA, 65% of total fat), polyunsaturated (PUFA, 76%) or monounsaturated (MUFA, 76%) fatty acids, and comprised 2 savoury muffins. Participants rated appetite sensations using visual analogue scales (VAS) to assess palatability immediately following the meals, and hunger and fullness prior to the HF breakfast and throughout the day. Energy intake was measured by covert weighing of a lunch meal which was served 3.5 h after the breakfast, and from which the participants ate <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p>\n<p>There was no difference in VAS ratings of pleasantness, visual appearance, smell, taste, aftertaste and overall palatability between the 3 high-fat test breakfasts. However, there was also no differential effect of the 3 treatments on ratings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction or prospective food consumption during the 3.5 h following the breakfast meal and over the full 6 h experiment. Energy and macronutrient intake at lunch also did not differ between treatments (mean, sem; SFA: 5275.9 \u00b1 286.5 kJ; PUFA: 5227.7 \u00b1 403.9 kJ; MUFA: 5215.6 \u00b1 329.5 kJ; P &gt; 0.05). The maximum difference in energy intake between treatments was less than 2%.</p>\n<p>There was no evidence of a difference in post-ingestion satiety between high fat meals which differed in saturation profile in this group of lean, healthy men.</p>\n<p>ACTRN12610000193077</p>",

Several studies have shown that the rate of postprandial fat oxidation, purported to act as a satiety feedback signal, is negatively related to the degree of saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>]. In early studies degree of saturation was also linked with changes in putative appetite modifiers such as CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>], insulin and serotonin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>]. In addition, effects on <italic>ad libitum </italic>energy intake (EI) have been reported. Whilst there is some evidence of PUFA having the strongest and MUFA the weakest suppression of food intake, clinical studies are inconsistent and variable. A gastrointestinal infusion study showed high-PUFA Intralipid<sup>\u00ae </sup>(a fat emulsion comprising largely soybean oil) and linoleic acid (18:2) to decrease intake when compared with a no-fat saline control, whilst carbon chain length (CCL) -matched stearic acid (C18:0, SFA) and oleic acid (C18:1, MUFA) did not [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. In a feeding study of CCL-matched fats, both high-PUFA and high-SFA meals decreased food intake when compared with high-MUFA meals [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>], and a second infusion study showed lauric acid (C12:0 SFA) but not the longer chain oleic acid (C18:1 MUFA) to decrease food intake relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, other studies have found less convincing [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] or no evidence of saturation affecting <italic>ad libitum </italic>EI or appetite ratings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], or with response differing by gender [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal.

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].

It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment.

It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>].

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

The inability of lipids to mount a strong postprandial satiety-related hormone response relative to the other macronutrients may also contribute [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",

Several studies have shown that the rate of postprandial fat oxidation, purported to act as a satiety feedback signal, is negatively related to the degree of saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>].

In addition, effects on <italic>ad libitum </italic>energy intake (EI) have been reported. Whilst there is some evidence of PUFA having the strongest and MUFA the weakest suppression of food intake, clinical studies are inconsistent and variable. A gastrointestinal infusion study showed high-PUFA Intralipid<sup>\u00ae </sup>(a fat emulsion comprising largely soybean oil) and linoleic acid (18:2) to decrease intake when compared with a no-fat saline control, whilst carbon chain length (CCL) -matched stearic acid (C18:0, SFA) and oleic acid (C18:1, MUFA) did not [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>].

Conversely, other studies have found less convincing [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] or no evidence of saturation affecting <italic>ad libitum </italic>EI or appetite ratings [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>], or with response differing by gender [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].</p>",

At the clinic body weight and waist circumference were measured fasted, and adverse events and/or medications used between treatments recorded.

A venous cannula was also inserted for sequential collection of blood samples throughout the morning, and lipid profile, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured.

Subjective feelings were recorded by placing a vertical line across 100 mm scales, anchored at either end by statements; \"I am not hungry at all/I am not full at all/I am completely empty/Nothing at all\" on the left and \"I am as hungry I have ever been/I am totally full/I cannot eat another bite/A large amount\" on the right. VAS rating how thirsty, energetic and relaxed the participants felt were included as a distraction from the main outcome.

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment.

It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

The inability of lipids to mount a strong postprandial satiety-related hormone response relative to the other macronutrients may also contribute [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study we were unable to show differential changes in postprandial feelings of hunger or fullness, or changes in energy intake at a lunch meal when alterations were made to the fatty acid saturation of a high-fat breakfast. Lipid dose, the interval between test-breakfast and <italic>ad libitum </italic>outcome lunch, and the composition of the <italic>ad lib </italic>meal have all been identified as areas which may bias outcome. In this study we administered a 26 g lipid test meal which was well matched for sensory outcomes between treatments, 3.5 hours prior to a free choice lunch meal. Whether a higher dose lipid product administered as a preload rather than test meal, i.e. closer to the lunch meal, would elicit an appetite response is unknown. Certainly there is little consensus on effects of dietary lipid composition on appetite control from previous studies. Whether appetite may be altered by longer term and sustained changes in dietary fatty acid composition also remains to be demonstrated.</p>"

                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study we were unable to show differential changes in postprandial feelings of hunger or fullness, or changes in energy intake at a lunch meal when alterations were made to the fatty acid saturation of a high-fat breakfast. Lipid dose, the interval between test-breakfast and <italic>ad libitum </italic>outcome lunch, and the composition of the <italic>ad lib </italic>meal have all been identified as areas which may bias outcome. In this study we administered a 26 g lipid test meal which was well matched for sensory outcomes between treatments, 3.5 hours prior to a free choice lunch meal. Whether a higher dose lipid product administered as a preload rather than test meal, i.e. closer to the lunch meal, would elicit an appetite response is unknown. Certainly there is little consensus on effects of dietary lipid composition on appetite control from previous studies. Whether appetite may be altered by longer term and sustained changes in dietary fatty acid composition also remains to be demonstrated.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>].

                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

Whether appetite may be altered by longer term and sustained changes in dietary fatty acid composition also remains to be demonstrated.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal.

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].

It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>",
                            "<p>In this study we were unable to show differential changes in postprandial feelings of hunger or fullness, or changes in energy intake at a lunch meal when alterations were made to the fatty acid saturation of a high-fat breakfast. Lipid dose, the interval between test-breakfast and <italic>ad libitum </italic>outcome lunch, and the composition of the <italic>ad lib </italic>meal have all been identified as areas which may bias outcome. In this study we administered a 26 g lipid test meal which was well matched for sensory outcomes between treatments, 3.5 hours prior to a free choice lunch meal. Whether a higher dose lipid product administered as a preload rather than test meal, i.e. closer to the lunch meal, would elicit an appetite response is unknown. Certainly there is little consensus on effects of dietary lipid composition on appetite control from previous studies. Whether appetite may be altered by longer term and sustained changes in dietary fatty acid composition also remains to be demonstrated.</p>"

The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment.

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>].

It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal.

Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>].

                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal.

                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>",

                            "<p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&gt;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p>",
                            "<p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"

                            "<p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p>",
                            "<p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T4\">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&gt;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p>"
