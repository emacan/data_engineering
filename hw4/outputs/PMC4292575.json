        "title": "Individual differences in executive control relate to metaphor processing: an eye movement study of sentence reading",
        "abstract": "<p>Metaphors are common elements of language that allow us to creatively stretch the limits of word meaning. However, metaphors vary in their degree of novelty, which determines whether people must create new meanings on-line or retrieve previously known metaphorical meanings from memory. Such variations affect the degree to which general cognitive capacities such as executive control are required for successful comprehension. We investigated whether individual differences in executive control relate to metaphor processing using eye movement measures of reading. Thirty-nine participants read sentences including metaphors or idioms, another form of figurative language that is more likely to rely on meaning retrieval. They also completed the AX-CPT, a domain-general executive control task. In Experiment 1, we examined sentences containing metaphorical or literal uses of verbs, presented with or without prior context. In Experiment 2, we examined sentences containing idioms or literal phrases for the same participants to determine whether the link to executive control was qualitatively similar or different to Experiment 1. When metaphors were low familiar, all people read verbs used as metaphors more slowly than verbs used literally (this difference was smaller for high familiar metaphors). Executive control capacity modulated this pattern in that high executive control readers spent more time reading verbs when a prior context forced a particular interpretation (metaphorical or literal), and they had faster total metaphor reading times when there was a prior context. Interestingly, executive control did not relate to idiom processing for the same readers. Here, all readers had faster total reading times for high familiar idioms than literal phrases. Thus, executive control relates to metaphor but not idiom processing for these readers, and for the particular metaphor and idiom reading manipulations presented.</p>",

This ensured that neither the verb nor the disambiguating context region was sentence-final.

To further assess the source and direction of this interaction, we computed sub-models where the data were median split into high and low metaphor-literal familiarity ratios.

In the category attribution view (Glucksberg, <xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2001</xref>, <xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2003</xref>), this would arise because people directly retrieve familiar metaphoric features, and easily suppress irrelevant features. In the feature alignment view (Bowdle and Gentner, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2005</xref>), this would arise because familiar senses of metaphors tend to become integrated over time with the literal word (see also Kintsch, <xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2000</xref>). Consistent with these views, the figurative meanings of familiar vs. unfamiliar metaphors are primed more quickly (Blasko and Connine, <xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1993</xref>), are judged more quickly in phrasal classification tasks (Mashal and Faust, <xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2009</xref>; Goldstein et al., <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2012</xref>), and undergo a less computationally intensive comparison process (Goldstein et al., <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2012</xref>; Lai and Curran, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>; Mashal, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>).

This suggests that the global effort needed to resolve a semantic commitment on the first pass is generally reduced for idioms compared to metaphors, perhaps due to the fact that relatively common idiomatic expressions enjoy a lexical boost due to the high co-occurrence of their component words (Wulff, <xref rid=\"B51\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2008</xref>). Thus, it is possible that idioms are so thoroughly lexicalized for native speakers of a language (even ones that are rated as low familiar) that people can partially anticipate their final words and thus get a head start on processing those words lexically and semantically (Cacciari and Tabossi, <xref rid=\"B9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1988</xref>; Titone and Connine, <xref rid=\"B49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1994</xref>; Libben and Titone, <xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2008</xref>). This state of affairs may be especially true for natural reading contexts, such as in the current study, where early anticipation of idiom-final words may be enhanced by some amount of parafoveal processing of upcoming words (Kliegl et al., <xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2007</xref>; Hohenstein et al., <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2010</xref>; Angele et al., <xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>). While parafoveal processing of words was also certainly possible for the metaphors in Experiment 1, these metaphors do not likely enjoy the same lexicalized, collocation status as idioms. Thus, readers may not have been as able to extract useful parafoveal information for metaphors that would enable a meaningful head start on processing.</p>"

Categorical predictors were deviation coded except where noted otherwise, and all continuous predictors were scaled to reduce collinearity. Maximum correlations among main effects were &lt;0.16 for each main model. Subjects and items (sentences) were random intercepts across the models; random slopes were included in models only when they were statistically warranted (cf.

In the category attribution view (Glucksberg, <xref rid=\"B20\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2001</xref>, <xref rid=\"B21\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2003</xref>), this would arise because people directly retrieve familiar metaphoric features, and easily suppress irrelevant features. In the feature alignment view (Bowdle and Gentner, <xref rid=\"B7\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2005</xref>), this would arise because familiar senses of metaphors tend to become integrated over time with the literal word (see also Kintsch, <xref rid=\"B27\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2000</xref>). Consistent with these views, the figurative meanings of familiar vs. unfamiliar metaphors are primed more quickly (Blasko and Connine, <xref rid=\"B6\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1993</xref>), are judged more quickly in phrasal classification tasks (Mashal and Faust, <xref rid=\"B35\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2009</xref>; Goldstein et al., <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2012</xref>), and undergo a less computationally intensive comparison process (Goldstein et al., <xref rid=\"B22\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2012</xref>; Lai and Curran, <xref rid=\"B32\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>; Mashal, <xref rid=\"B34\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>).

This suggests that the global effort needed to resolve a semantic commitment on the first pass is generally reduced for idioms compared to metaphors, perhaps due to the fact that relatively common idiomatic expressions enjoy a lexical boost due to the high co-occurrence of their component words (Wulff, <xref rid=\"B51\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2008</xref>). Thus, it is possible that idioms are so thoroughly lexicalized for native speakers of a language (even ones that are rated as low familiar) that people can partially anticipate their final words and thus get a head start on processing those words lexically and semantically (Cacciari and Tabossi, <xref rid=\"B9\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1988</xref>; Titone and Connine, <xref rid=\"B49\" ref-type=\"bibr\">1994</xref>; Libben and Titone, <xref rid=\"B33\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2008</xref>). This state of affairs may be especially true for natural reading contexts, such as in the current study, where early anticipation of idiom-final words may be enhanced by some amount of parafoveal processing of upcoming words (Kliegl et al., <xref rid=\"B31\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2007</xref>; Hohenstein et al., <xref rid=\"B24\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2010</xref>; Angele et al., <xref rid=\"B1\" ref-type=\"bibr\">2013</xref>). While parafoveal processing of words was also certainly possible for the metaphors in Experiment 1, these metaphors do not likely enjoy the same lexicalized, collocation status as idioms. Thus, readers may not have been as able to extract useful parafoveal information for metaphors that would enable a meaningful head start on processing.</p>"
