        "abstract": "<p>People often have misperceptions (overestimation or underestimation) about the health-related behaviours they engage in, which may have adverse consequences for their susceptibility to behavioural change. Misperception is usually measured by combining and comparing quantified behavioural self-reports with subjective classification of the behaviour. Researchers assume that such assessments of misperception are not influenced by the order of the two types of measurement, but this has never been studied. Based on the precaution adoption model and the information processing theory, it might be expected that taking the subjective measurement after a detailed quantified behavioural self-report would improve the accuracy of the subjective measurement because the quantified report urges a person to think more in detail about their own behaviour.</p>\n<p>In an experiment (n = 521), quantified self-report and subjective assessment were manipulated in a questionnaire. In one version, the quantified self-report was presented before the subjective assessment, whereas in the other version, the subjective assessment came first.</p>\n<p>Neither subjective assessment nor overestimation of physical activity were biased by the order of the questions. Underestimation was more prevalent among subgroups of the group which answered the subjective assessment after the quantified self-report.</p>\n<p>Question order in questionnaires does not seem to influence misperceptions concerning physical activity in groups relevant for health education (overestimators: those who do not meet the guidelines forphysical activity while rating their physical activity as sufficient orhigh). The small order effect found in underestimators is less relevant for health education because this subgroup already meets the guideline and therefore does not need to change behaviour.</p>",

                            "<p>Our comparison of underestimators with realists showed that involvement in physical activity predicted underestimation of the behaviour, while the effect of the order of questions was borderline significant. Underestimators of physical activity are, however, not very interesting to health educators, since these persons are already meeting the national Dutch (NNGB) guideline and therefore do not need to change their physical activity behaviour. This means that there is no urgency for health educators to invest in this group. In order to increase public health, they should primarily invest in persons who are not meeting the guideline (overestimators and low realists). From the perspective of the aim of this study, the important finding is that the extent of overestimation is not influenced by the order of the questions. Involvement and health moderated the effect of question order on the degree of underestimation. Stratified analyses among those who perceived health as an important or very important reason to be physically active showed that those who filled in the quantified behavioural self report before the subjective assessment were more likely to underestimate their physical activity than those who completed them in the opposite order. The same was true for those who were less involved in physical activity. Both findings were borderline significant. Rimal and Real [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], who assessed the perceived importance of skin cancer related to issue involvement and question-order effects, also found an interaction effect between involvement and question order. Like us, these researchers found that high involvement was not associated with question-order effects, but low involvement was (at borderline significance in our study). This is in agreement with the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which assumes greater context-related effects (i.e. those of question order) among respondents with low involvement, because they process information via a peripheral route [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. It is harder to understand why those who rate health as the most important reason to be active are affected by question order (at borderline significance in our study).</p>",

The results of the t-tests and linear regression showed no effect of the order in which the questions were presented on the subjective estimation of behaviour. Our Anova analysis of misperception from the perspective of four categories (underestimators, overestimators, realistic high estimators, realistic low estimators, all relative to the Dutch national guideline, Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) did not show an influence of question order on the occurrence of misperception either. Nor did it reveal any interaction effects between outcome expectations, involvement and question order. The Anova analyses did, however, show that the four categories differed from each other in terms of involvement and of most outcome expectations. People who perceived their physical activity level as adequate (realistic high estimators and overestimators) had higher scores on all reasons to be active (except weight) than those who did not perceive their activity behaviour as adequate (realistic low estimators and underestimators). People with misperceptions did not differ in their judgment on the importance of health from those without misperception. There were two exceptions: overestimators saw relaxation as a more important reason to be active and expressed less involvement in physical activity than realistic low estimators and underestimators. The findings suggest that people may use not only health but also other benchmarks (e.g. relaxation) in their subjective estimation of the adequacy of their behaviour. The results do not, however, suggest that only misperceptors (i.e. overestimators and underestimators) use different benchmarks for assessing their physical activity involvement.

The quantified behavioural self-report used the SQUASH instrument [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>], which had been validated in a previous study with the help of a Computer Science and Applications (CSA) inc. activity monitor [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. The correlation coefficient for validity in that study was 0.45 (95% CI 0.17\u20130.66). The exact agreement between the SQUASH scores and those of the CSA was 46% and the weighted kappa 0.30. Correlations for the reproducibility of the individual questions had a mean value of 0.75 and varied between 0.44 and 0.96 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. SQUASH is widely accepted as an instrument to measure physical activity and has been used in a number of studies [e.g. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>]]. It is considered an acceptable substitute for objective activity measures like accelerometers, heart rate counters and other observation instruments [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>]. SQUASH [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>] consists of 14 questions on a total of four domains of physical activity (i.e. commuting activities like walking to/from work; leisure time activities like gardening and sports; household activities like cooking and activities at work and/or school, like regularly lifting heavy objects at work). The questions assess the number of days per week on which respondents engage in an activity, the average time spent on that activity per day and the intensity of the activity. Based on these questions, an overall SQUASH score on physical activity is calculated using an algorithm corrected for age, because age determines the intensity of an activity.</p>",

Since interactions may cause unreliable odds ratios and p-values [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>], four additional logistic regression analyses were carried out in which the effects of order were tested for a number of subgroups, based on 'health as a reason to be active' and 'involvement'. For the purpose of these stratified analyses, two subgroups were formed on the basis of 'health as a reason to be active'. One subgroup consisted of respondents who stated that health was an important or very important reason for them to be active (n = 380), while the other subgroup consisted of people for whom health was no reason or only a minor reason to be active (n = 55). We also formed a subgroup with respondents who were not or hardly involved in physical activity (n = 67) and a group of involved or highly involved respondents (n = 366). Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">5</xref> shows the results of the stratified analyses for each of the four subgroups. Among those who considered health to be an important or very important reason to be physically active, the SQ condition resulted in less underestimation, though at borderline significance.

The results of the t-tests and linear regression showed no effect of the order in which the questions were presented on the subjective estimation of behaviour. Our Anova analysis of misperception from the perspective of four categories (underestimators, overestimators, realistic high estimators, realistic low estimators, all relative to the Dutch national guideline, Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) did not show an influence of question order on the occurrence of misperception either. Nor did it reveal any interaction effects between outcome expectations, involvement and question order. The Anova analyses did, however, show that the four categories differed from each other in terms of involvement and of most outcome expectations. People who perceived their physical activity level as adequate (realistic high estimators and overestimators) had higher scores on all reasons to be active (except weight) than those who did not perceive their activity behaviour as adequate (realistic low estimators and underestimators). People with misperceptions did not differ in their judgment on the importance of health from those without misperception. There were two exceptions: overestimators saw relaxation as a more important reason to be active and expressed less involvement in physical activity than realistic low estimators and underestimators. The findings suggest that people may use not only health but also other benchmarks (e.g. relaxation) in their subjective estimation of the adequacy of their behaviour. The results do not, however, suggest that only misperceptors (i.e. overestimators and underestimators) use different benchmarks for assessing their physical activity involvement. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the categories in terms of involvement and outcome expectancies, we refer to a previous study by Lechner, Bolman and Van Dijke [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The present study showed that 67% of the respondents met the NNGB guideline, while 16% overestimated and 15% underestimated their physical activity. Overestimators were those who subjectively estimated their behaviour as sufficient while not actually meeting the NNGB guideline, as derived from the quantified behavioural self-report assessment by means of the SQUASH instrument. Underestimators were those who did meet the guideline, though they subjectively estimated their behaviour as insufficient. Half of those who did not meet the NNGB guideline thought that they were doing fine (the so-called overestimators). We found 10% less misperception than Ronda and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], though the percentage was comparable to that found by De Ridder and Lechner [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This might be partly explained by the fact that those researchers used a different instrument for the quantified self-report of physical activity. Our quantified assessment of physical activity with SQUASH [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] was more detailed, and corrected for age. Also in line with the study by De Ridder &amp; Lechner, but different from other studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>], was our finding that two thirds of the respondents met the NNGB norm; the other studies reported 40\u201355%. Again, these differences might be related to the instruments that were used, and the age correction in the SQUASH. In agreement with the guidelines proposed by Wendel-Vos &amp; Schuit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>], the algorithm we used in the present study to calculate the total SQUASH score took age into account in calculating intensity categories (light, moderate and vigorous) for physical activities. For example, vigorous activities for 55+ participants meant \u2265 5 MET, while for adults they were \u2265 6.5 MET. Previous studies may not have applied the age corrections.</p>",
                            "<p>Our study was limited by the fact that our sample did not reflect the general Dutch population. Our sample was slightly older and more likely to meet the guideline for physical activity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>]. This may have had consequences for the reported physical activity and the possible predictors of misperception, and may therefore affect the generalizability of the results. Also, our response rate, though comparable to that in most other similar studies, was only slightly over 50%. It is, however, unlikely that these aspects have affected the results of the experiment (i.e., the effect of the order of quantified behavioural self-report and subjective assessment questions). The nature of our research question reduced the need for generalizability. The study may have suffered from type I errors due to multiple testing. Although we used a validated and widely accepted quantified behavioural self-report scale of physical activity (SQUASH), we could have strengthened our study by collecting corroborating data that would support the validity of this instrument (e.g., accelerometers). We only studied the effect of question order on misperception in self-administered questionnaires, and it is possible that question order effects on misperception might exist in telephone-administered interviews, another important mode of data collection in health education research. This is suggested by several experimental studies that showed clear question-order effects in telephone surveys, while not finding such effects in self-administered questionnaires [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>].</p>"

Underestimators of physical activity are, however, not very interesting to health educators, since these persons are already meeting the national Dutch (NNGB) guideline and therefore do not need to change their physical activity behaviour. This means that there is no urgency for health educators to invest in this group. In order to increase public health, they should primarily invest in persons who are not meeting the guideline (overestimators and low realists). From the perspective of the aim of this study, the important finding is that the extent of overestimation is not influenced by the order of the questions. Involvement and health moderated the effect of question order on the degree of underestimation. Stratified analyses among those who perceived health as an important or very important reason to be physically active showed that those who filled in the quantified behavioural self report before the subjective assessment were more likely to underestimate their physical activity than those who completed them in the opposite order. The same was true for those who were less involved in physical activity. Both findings were borderline significant. Rimal and Real [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], who assessed the perceived importance of skin cancer related to issue involvement and question-order effects, also found an interaction effect between involvement and question order. Like us, these researchers found that high involvement was not associated with question-order effects, but low involvement was (at borderline significance in our study). This is in agreement with the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which assumes greater context-related effects (i.e. those of question order) among respondents with low involvement, because they process information via a peripheral route [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. It is harder to understand why those who rate health as the most important reason to be active are affected by question order (at borderline significance in our study).</p>"

Underestimators of physical activity are, however, not very interesting to health educators, since these persons are already meeting the national Dutch (NNGB) guideline and therefore do not need to change their physical activity behaviour. This means that there is no urgency for health educators to invest in this group. In order to increase public health, they should primarily invest in persons who are not meeting the guideline (overestimators and low realists). From the perspective of the aim of this study, the important finding is that the extent of overestimation is not influenced by the order of the questions. Involvement and health moderated the effect of question order on the degree of underestimation. Stratified analyses among those who perceived health as an important or very important reason to be physically active showed that those who filled in the quantified behavioural self report before the subjective assessment were more likely to underestimate their physical activity than those who completed them in the opposite order. The same was true for those who were less involved in physical activity. Both findings were borderline significant. Rimal and Real [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], who assessed the perceived importance of skin cancer related to issue involvement and question-order effects, also found an interaction effect between involvement and question order. Like us, these researchers found that high involvement was not associated with question-order effects, but low involvement was (at borderline significance in our study). This is in agreement with the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which assumes greater context-related effects (i.e. those of question order) among respondents with low involvement, because they process information via a peripheral route [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. It is harder to understand why those who rate health as the most important reason to be active are affected by question order (at borderline significance in our study).</p>"

Since interactions may cause unreliable odds ratios and p-values [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>], four additional logistic regression analyses were carried out in which the effects of order were tested for a number of subgroups, based on 'health as a reason to be active' and 'involvement'. For the purpose of these stratified analyses, two subgroups were formed on the basis of 'health as a reason to be active'. One subgroup consisted of respondents who stated that health was an important or very important reason for them to be active (n = 380), while the other subgroup consisted of people for whom health was no reason or only a minor reason to be active (n = 55). We also formed a subgroup with respondents who were not or hardly involved in physical activity (n = 67) and a group of involved or highly involved respondents (n = 366). Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T5\">5</xref> shows the results of the stratified analyses for each of the four subgroups. Among those who considered health to be an important or very important reason to be physically active, the SQ condition resulted in less underestimation, though at borderline significance.

Misperceptions often relate to behaviours for which there is no obvious dividing line between what is healthy or unhealthy or adequate to prevent disease [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].

Furthermore, it is likely that people with misperceptions about their own behaviour do not pay attention to messages in health education interventions because they think these messages do not apply to them. Studies of the consequences of misperception have shown that people who think that their behaviour is adequate have less intention to change [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].

This might imply that question order could also influence the extent of misperception. Therefore, this study assessed whether the order of the subjective and quantified behavioural self-reports influenced the results (i.e. the extent of misperception).

In the first logistic regression analysis, underestimators were omitted and overestimators were compared with realists. In the second logistic regression analysis, overestimators were omitted and underestimators were compared with realists.

The results of the t-tests and linear regression showed no effect of the order in which the questions were presented on the subjective estimation of behaviour. Our Anova analysis of misperception from the perspective of four categories (underestimators, overestimators, realistic high estimators, realistic low estimators, all relative to the Dutch national guideline, Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) did not show an influence of question order on the occurrence of misperception either. Nor did it reveal any interaction effects between outcome expectations, involvement and question order. The Anova analyses did, however, show that the four categories differed from each other in terms of involvement and of most outcome expectations. People who perceived their physical activity level as adequate (realistic high estimators and overestimators) had higher scores on all reasons to be active (except weight) than those who did not perceive their activity behaviour as adequate (realistic low estimators and underestimators). People with misperceptions did not differ in their judgment on the importance of health from those without misperception. There were two exceptions: overestimators saw relaxation as a more important reason to be active and expressed less involvement in physical activity than realistic low estimators and underestimators. The findings suggest that people may use not only health but also other benchmarks (e.g. relaxation) in their subjective estimation of the adequacy of their behaviour. The results do not, however, suggest that only misperceptors (i.e. overestimators and underestimators) use different benchmarks for assessing their physical activity involvement. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the categories in terms of involvement and outcome expectancies, we refer to a previous study by Lechner, Bolman and Van Dijke [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

Overestimators were those who subjectively estimated their behaviour as sufficient while not actually meeting the NNGB guideline, as derived from the quantified behavioural self-report assessment by means of the SQUASH instrument. Underestimators were those who did meet the guideline, though they subjectively estimated their behaviour as insufficient. Half of those who did not meet the NNGB guideline thought that they were doing fine (the so-called overestimators). We found 10% less misperception than Ronda and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], though the percentage was comparable to that found by De Ridder and Lechner [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This might be partly explained by the fact that those researchers used a different instrument for the quantified self-report of physical activity. Our quantified assessment of physical activity with SQUASH [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] was more detailed, and corrected for age.

In agreement with the guidelines proposed by Wendel-Vos &amp; Schuit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>], the algorithm we used in the present study to calculate the total SQUASH score took age into account in calculating intensity categories (light, moderate and vigorous) for physical activities.

From the perspective of the aim of this study, the important finding is that the extent of overestimation is not influenced by the order of the questions. Involvement and health moderated the effect of question order on the degree of underestimation. Stratified analyses among those who perceived health as an important or very important reason to be physically active showed that those who filled in the quantified behavioural self report before the subjective assessment were more likely to underestimate their physical activity than those who completed them in the opposite order. The same was true for those who were less involved in physical activity. Both findings were borderline significant.

                            "<p>Our comparison of underestimators with realists showed that involvement in physical activity predicted underestimation of the behaviour, while the effect of the order of questions was borderline significant. Underestimators of physical activity are, however, not very interesting to health educators, since these persons are already meeting the national Dutch (NNGB) guideline and therefore do not need to change their physical activity behaviour. This means that there is no urgency for health educators to invest in this group. In order to increase public health, they should primarily invest in persons who are not meeting the guideline (overestimators and low realists). From the perspective of the aim of this study, the important finding is that the extent of overestimation is not influenced by the order of the questions. Involvement and health moderated the effect of question order on the degree of underestimation. Stratified analyses among those who perceived health as an important or very important reason to be physically active showed that those who filled in the quantified behavioural self report before the subjective assessment were more likely to underestimate their physical activity than those who completed them in the opposite order. The same was true for those who were less involved in physical activity. Both findings were borderline significant. Rimal and Real [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>], who assessed the perceived importance of skin cancer related to issue involvement and question-order effects, also found an interaction effect between involvement and question order. Like us, these researchers found that high involvement was not associated with question-order effects, but low involvement was (at borderline significance in our study). This is in agreement with the Elaboration Likelihood Model, which assumes greater context-related effects (i.e. those of question order) among respondents with low involvement, because they process information via a peripheral route [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. It is harder to understand why those who rate health as the most important reason to be active are affected by question order (at borderline significance in our study).</p>"

Since interactions may cause unreliable odds ratios and p-values [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>], four additional logistic regression analyses were carried out in which the effects of order were tested for a number of subgroups, based on 'health as a reason to be active' and 'involvement'. For the purpose of these stratified analyses, two subgroups were formed on the basis of 'health as a reason to be active'. One subgroup consisted of respondents who stated that health was an important or very important reason for them to be active (n = 380), while the other subgroup consisted of people for whom health was no reason or only a minor reason to be active (n = 55). We also formed a subgroup with respondents who were not or hardly involved in physical activity (n = 67) and a group of involved or highly involved respondents (n = 366).

According to the Precaution Adoption Process Model [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>], people need to be aware of their own risk behaviour before they are susceptible to behavioural change and may change their risk behaviour. Furthermore, it is likely that people with misperceptions about their own behaviour do not pay attention to messages in health education interventions because they think these messages do not apply to them. Studies of the consequences of misperception have shown that people who think that their behaviour is adequate have less intention to change [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>]. In terms of their attitude, self-efficacy and the social influence they perceive, these people are comparable to those who actually behave in accordance with the health guidelines [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>].</p>",

These studies, on fruit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], vegetable [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>] and physical activity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>], showed that misperception is correlated with the way in which and the extent to which persons make interpersonal comparisons. People who erroneously classify themselves as behaving in a healthy way are more likely to compare themselves with those who are perceived to engage in equally healthy or less healthy behaviour (downward comparison) and rate their own behaviour as healthier than that of these others (optimistic bias) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>",

This might imply that question order could also influence the extent of misperception. Therefore, this study assessed whether the order of the subjective and quantified behavioural self-reports influenced the results (i.e. the extent of misperception). Answering this question is relevant to future studies that try to explain and change health behaviours in general and those on misperceptions about health behaviours in particular. We chose physical activity behaviour as the behaviour to test this on.</p>",

This would justify the measurement procedure used so far. Nevertheless, the studies on question-order effects referred to above suggested that there might be an influence. Furthermore, based on the Precaution Adoption Process Model [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>] and the Information Processing Theory [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], we considered it likely that filling in a detailed quantified questionnaire on physical activity behaviour would help respondents become aware of their own behaviour (in terms of risk) and would therefore result in a more accurate subjective estimation of the behaviour (i.e. in less misperception). Based on these two theories [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>], we therefore expected that a detailed quantified behavioural self-report in our study would activate prior knowledge (revealing respondents' own activities and knowledge about physical activity behaviour) and would induce respondents to think about their own behaviour in more detail.

These analyses in separate groups were needed since overestimators and underestimators had to be compared separately with realists to prevent reciprocal influences (if overestimation and underestimation were taken together, their scores would average out). In the first logistic regression analysis, underestimators were omitted and overestimators were compared with realists. In the second logistic regression analysis, overestimators were omitted and underestimators were compared with realists. In both analyses, the main effects of the order of the questions, involvement and reasons to be active were tested by entering them as one block in the first step. Interactions were added in step two, using a hierarchical backward elimination procedure. Non-significant interaction terms (P &lt; .10) were removed one by one [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>].

The results of the t-tests and linear regression showed no effect of the order in which the questions were presented on the subjective estimation of behaviour. Our Anova analysis of misperception from the perspective of four categories (underestimators, overestimators, realistic high estimators, realistic low estimators, all relative to the Dutch national guideline, Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>) did not show an influence of question order on the occurrence of misperception either. Nor did it reveal any interaction effects between outcome expectations, involvement and question order. The Anova analyses did, however, show that the four categories differed from each other in terms of involvement and of most outcome expectations. People who perceived their physical activity level as adequate (realistic high estimators and overestimators) had higher scores on all reasons to be active (except weight) than those who did not perceive their activity behaviour as adequate (realistic low estimators and underestimators). People with misperceptions did not differ in their judgment on the importance of health from those without misperception. There were two exceptions: overestimators saw relaxation as a more important reason to be active and expressed less involvement in physical activity than realistic low estimators and underestimators. The findings suggest that people may use not only health but also other benchmarks (e.g. relaxation) in their subjective estimation of the adequacy of their behaviour. The results do not, however, suggest that only misperceptors (i.e. overestimators and underestimators) use different benchmarks for assessing their physical activity involvement. For a detailed analysis of the differences between the categories in terms of involvement and outcome expectancies, we refer to a previous study by Lechner, Bolman and Van Dijke [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>",

This suggests that more is needed to estimate one's behaviour appropriately.

This implies that correcting misperceptions always requires a combination of detailed quantified behavioural self-report and feedback. The feedback should include information on whether the person meets the guideline.</p>",
                            "<p>The present study showed that 67% of the respondents met the NNGB guideline, while 16% overestimated and 15% underestimated their physical activity. Overestimators were those who subjectively estimated their behaviour as sufficient while not actually meeting the NNGB guideline, as derived from the quantified behavioural self-report assessment by means of the SQUASH instrument. Underestimators were those who did meet the guideline, though they subjectively estimated their behaviour as insufficient. Half of those who did not meet the NNGB guideline thought that they were doing fine (the so-called overestimators). We found 10% less misperception than Ronda and colleagues [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], though the percentage was comparable to that found by De Ridder and Lechner [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. This might be partly explained by the fact that those researchers used a different instrument for the quantified self-report of physical activity. Our quantified assessment of physical activity with SQUASH [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] was more detailed, and corrected for age. Also in line with the study by De Ridder &amp; Lechner, but different from other studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>], was our finding that two thirds of the respondents met the NNGB norm; the other studies reported 40\u201355%. Again, these differences might be related to the instruments that were used, and the age correction in the SQUASH. In agreement with the guidelines proposed by Wendel-Vos &amp; Schuit [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B33\">33</xref>], the algorithm we used in the present study to calculate the total SQUASH score took age into account in calculating intensity categories (light, moderate and vigorous) for physical activities. For example, vigorous activities for 55+ participants meant \u2265 5 MET, while for adults they were \u2265 6.5 MET. Previous studies may not have applied the age corrections.</p>"

Two-way Anova's with Games-Howell post-hoc analyses [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>] were conducted for the four categories of Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F1\">1</xref>, while hierarchical logistic regression analyses were carried out in two separate groups [one group in which overestimators were compared with realists (i.e., the combination of realistic low and realistic high categories) and one group in which underestimators were compared with realists. These analyses in separate groups were needed since overestimators and underestimators had to be compared separately with realists to prevent reciprocal influences (if overestimation and underestimation were taken together, their scores would average out). In the first logistic regression analysis, underestimators were omitted and overestimators were compared with realists. In the second logistic regression analysis, overestimators were omitted and underestimators were compared with realists. In both analyses, the main effects of the order of the questions, involvement and reasons to be active were tested by entering them as one block in the first step. Interactions were added in step two, using a hierarchical backward elimination procedure. Non-significant interaction terms (P &lt; .10) were removed one by one [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>]. If any significant interaction remained between question order and one of the other variables, the effect of order was stratified to this variable.</p>",

Z-transformed mean scores for the difference between the quantified behavioural self-report and subjective assessments of behaviour were not significantly different between the QS (M = .056, SD = 1.09) and SQ (M = -.047, SD = 1.10) groups (t(512) = 1.075, P = .28). T-tests showed no differences between the QS and SQ groups in terms of the total SQUASH scores nor in the scores on the subjective assessment of activity. Means of the total SQUASH scores for the QS and SQ groups were 7.55 (SD = 5.35) and 7.49 (5.38), respectively (t(514) = 0.135, P = .89).
