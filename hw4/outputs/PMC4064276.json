        "abstract": "<p>To evaluate the ovarian reserve function in female patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS).</p>\n<p>This study evaluated 136 subjects, 67 with MetS and 69 controls. Subjects were divided into three age groups. Group I included 49 subjects aged 20\u201329 years, 22 with MetS and 27 controls; group II included 45 subjects aged 30\u201339 years, 22 with MetS and 23 controls; and group III included 42 subjects aged 40\u201349 years, 23 with MetS and 19 controls. Demographic characteristics, anthropometrics, blood biochemistry, and gonadotrophic hormones were compared as total ovarian volume and antral follicle count on ovarian transvaginal ultrasonography.</p>\n<p>Serum levels of FSH, LH, E2 and progesterone were similar in the MetS and control groups, while testosterone levels were significantly higher in MetS patients than controls, both in the overall population (p\u2009=\u20090.024) and in those aged 20\u201329 years (p\u2009=\u20090.018). Total ovarian volume was significantly lower in MetS patients than controls, in both the overall population (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and those aged 20\u201329 years (p\u2009=\u20090.018), while antral follicle counts were similar. Ovarian volume correlated positively with antral follicle count (AFC) (r\u2009=\u20090.37; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and negatively with age (r\u2009=\u20090.34; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001) and FSH concentration (r\u2009=\u20090.21; p\u2009=\u20090.013). AFC was negatively correlated with age (r\u2009=\u20090.36; p\u2009&lt;\u20090.001).</p>\n<p>Ovarian reserve function is significantly lower in MetS patients than in healthy control subjects, particularly in women aged 20\u201329 years.</p>",

Ovarian reserve is a measure of the reproductive potential of a woman in relation to primordial follicle count and oocyte quality. Follicle response to stimulation and fertility promoting medications is reduced in parallel to the reduction in ovarian reserve. Determinants of ovarian reserve include basal FSH and inhibin B levels (4), estradiol and LH concentrations, LH/FSH ratio, response to stimulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), ovarian volume, total antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian stromal blood flow [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>]. A meta-analysis found that AFC was a better predictor of ovarian response than basal FSH level [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>], and several studies have shown that AFC, as determined by high-resolution transvaginal ultrasonography, is a significant predictor of ovarian response [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>].</p>",

Total ovarian volume (cm<sup>3</sup>) and AFC were determined by ovarian transvaginal ultrasonography.</p>"
