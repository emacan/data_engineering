        "title": "Comparative analysis of microRNA expression in mouse and human brown adipose tissue",
        "abstract": "<p>In small mammals brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a predominant role in regulating energy expenditure (EE) via adaptive thermogenesis. New-born babies require BAT to control their body temperature, however its relevance in adults has been questioned. Active BAT has recently been observed in adult humans, albeit in much lower relative quantities than small mammals. Comparing and contrasting the molecular mechanisms controlling BAT growth and development in mice and humans will increase our understanding or how human BAT is developed and may identify potential therapeutic targets to increase EE. MicroRNAs are molecular mechanisms involved in mouse BAT development however, little is known about the miRNA profile in human BAT. The aims of this study were to establish a mouse BAT-enriched miRNA profile and compare this with miRNAs measured in human BAT. To achieve this we firstly established a mouse BAT enriched-miRNA profile by comparing miRNAs expressed in mouse BAT, white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Following this the BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes potentially involved in growth and development were identified.</p>\n<p>MiRNA levels were measured using PCR-based miRNA arrays. Results were analysed using ExpressionSuite software with the global mean expression value of all expressed miRNAs in a givensample used as the normalisation factor. Bio-informatic analyses was used to predict gene targets followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.</p>\n<p>We identified 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes potentially involved in growth and development. We also identified 145 miRNAs expressed in both mouse and human BAT, of which 25 were enriched in mouse BAT. Of these 25 miRNAs, miR-20a was predicted to target MYF5 and PPAR\u03b3, two important genes involved in brown adipogenesis, as well as BMP2 and BMPR2, genes involved in white adipogenesis. For the first time, 69 miRNAs were identified in human BAT but absent in mouse BAT, and 181 miRNAs were expressed in mouse but not in human BAT.</p>\n<p>The present study has identified a small sub-set of miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT. From this sub-set bioinformatics analysis suggested a potential role of miR-20a in the control of cell fate and this warrants further investigation. The large number of miRNAs found only in mouse BAT or only in human BAT highlights the differing molecular profile between species that is likely to influence the functional role of BAT across species. Nevertheless the BAT-enriched miRNA profiles established in the present study suggest targets to investigate in the control BAT development and EE.</p>\n<p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12864-015-2045-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p>",

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans. Inhibition of miR-193a/b and/or miR-365 in mouse primary brown pre-adipocytes impairs brown adipogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>"

Investigation of a broader number of BAT miRNA targets using highly sensitive qPCR-array methods will provide a more comprehensive overview of the potential miRNAs regulating BAT development and function.

MiR-27 is decreased in mouse BAT following cold exposure and during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR22\">22</xref>].

Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>"

This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>"

Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.

In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",
                            "<p>This study has identified 64 miRNAs enriched in mouse BAT when compared to skeletal muscle and WAT, including 35 miRNAs specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

The RNA samples were originally obtained as a component of a previously published study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. This previously published human study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CHLA (CCI-10-00073). The Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee Executive also reviewed the project (CCI-10-00073) and acknowledged the approval granted by the Institutional Review Board of the CHLA and allocated the project reference number 2015\u2013189. Written informed consent was obtained by all parent/legal guardian(s) in the presence of a witness authorizing post-mortem examination and removal of tissues. Authorization was also given for the samples to be retained and preserved and to be used for diagnostic, therapeutic and other scientific purposes as deemed appropriate by the examining physician or surgeon. The research was carried out on in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. The samples were surgically removed from the subcutaneous supraclavicular/supracervical area, intra-abdominal area or retroperitoneal area during post-mortem examination 24h after death and have been used previously of mRNA measurements [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>]. miRNAs are exceptionally stable post-mortem [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR47\">47</xref>] and therefore the miRNA profile generated would be representative of that observed in a living human. All tissue samples were snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at \u221280\u00b0C until required for RNA extraction.</p>"

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",
                            "<p>This study has identified 64 miRNAs enriched in mouse BAT when compared to skeletal muscle and WAT, including 35 miRNAs specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways.

This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs.

In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT.

However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function.

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development.

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",

These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>"

                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",

Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development.

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].

Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>"

Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>"

                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>"

The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined.

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
                            "<p>In the present study BAT from newborns was used to establish the human BAT miRNA profile. How precisely these findings translate to the human adult is presently unknown. Human newborns and adults have a similar distribution of BAT depots [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>]. In newborns and infants BAT is mostly located in the interscapular, cervical and perirenal regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR43\">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>]. In human adults the major depots of metabolically active BAT have been identified in the cervical, supraclavicular, axillary and paravertebral regions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>]. The location and quantity of human BAT alters with age, which may indicate an age-dependent change in its primary role; presently the precise functional role of adult BAT is yet to be determined. However, when the hands of both infants and adults are cooled there is a 0.3-0.7\u00b0C increase in subcutaneous cervical BAT, albeit to a lesser degree in older subjects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR45\">45</xref>]. This suggests that both infant and adult BAT may respond in a similar way to some external stress signals. Several studies have tried to develop a mRNA profile to establish how similarly infant and adult human BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>] and brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR44\">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR46\">46</xref>] mimic the \u201cclassical\u201d rodent BAT on a molecular level. Depending on the depth and location of the tissue analysed, infant and adult human BAT possess gene signatures with a mixture of \u201cclassical\u201d BAT and \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. The present study analysed newborn BAT taken from regions where active BAT is also found in the human adult. Therefore, it is most likely that the newborn human BAT miRNA profile established here would represent an adult profile with a mixture of \u201cclassic\u201d BAT and/or \u201cbeige-like\u201d adipocytes. Investigations are still required to clearly identify the mRNA and the miRNA species that are truly specific to brown and beige tissue; a task that that may complicated by the different levels of heterogeneity within BAT tissue depots.</p>",

Furthermore, for the first time a comparison between human and mouse BAT revealed the presence of 145 commonly expressed miRNAs in BAT from both species. These included 25 miRNAs specifically expressed in mouse BAT and involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. The identification of BAT-enriched miRNAs, conserved in both mouse and human BAT, such as miR-20a, may be a common factor controlling BAT development. Several of the newly identified miRNAs, common to mouse and human BAT, should be evaluated for their direct role in brown adipogenesis.</p>",

                            "<p>The recent discovery of active BAT in human adults [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR35\">35</xref>] has opened a new field of investigation for the treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms, regulating human BAT development may identify novel therapeutic strategies to increase energy expenditure. miRNAs are important molecular switches that display high levels of tissue enrichment and can control cell differentiation and tissue growth and development. Studies have investigated miRNAs in mouse BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>], however their expression levels have not been validated in human BAT. The present study measured and compared the expression of miRNAs highly enriched in mouse and human BAT, as well as predicting their gene targets potentially involved in BAT growth and development. Several novel observations were made. Firstly, 64 miRNAs were exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT in comparison to mouse skeletal muscle and WAT. Secondly, of these 64 BAT-enriched miRNAs, 35 were predicted to regulate genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. Thirdly, 145 miRNAs were found to be commonly expressed in human and mouse BAT. Finally, 25 of these 145 miRNAs were also identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development.</p>",
                            "<p>Identifying the molecular mechanisms (i.e. miRNAs) controlling BAT development has become a priority to develop therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity. While BAT shares a common origin with skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], studies in mouse WAT recently discovered a phenomenon called \u201cbrowning\u201d that involves the formation of brown adipocytes in WAT after cold exposure or \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR36\">36</xref>]. Therefore, it was of interest to compare these three mouse tissues in order to identify BAT-enriched miRNAs. In the present study, qPCR-based miRNA screening of ~750 miRNAs identified 64 miRNAs exclusively or highly expressed in mouse BAT, in comparison to skeletal muscle and WAT. Consistent with a similar study [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>], we identified that ~22% of the miRNAs commonly expressed between the three tissues were significantly higher in BAT. Of the 64 miRNAs observed to be enriched in mouse BAT in the present study, only 15 have previously in BAT [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>miRNAs regulate various component of cellular networks and maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR37\">37</xref>]. Therefore it was of interest to select BAT-enriched miRNAs that were predicted to target genes specifically involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development and as such may also control BAT development. Thirty-five of the 64 miRNAs were predicted to target 859 genes involved in growth and development pathways. In cultured adipocytes, global deep sequencing identified 16 and 12 miRNAs that were differentially regulated in mouse primary pre-adipocytes when compared with differentiated mature brown adipocytes in vitro<italic>,</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>]. Of the miRNAs upregulated in differentiated mature brown adipocytes, miR-142-3p and -19a were also up-regulated in the present list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs predicted to target genes involved in growth and differentiation. This supports a potential role of these miRNAs during BAT development in mice. While miR-155 and \u2212328 were down-regulated in mature brown adipocytes when compared to pre-adipocytes, they were identified as being upregulated in our list of 35 BAT-enriched miRNAs. These discrepancies may be indicative of the differences between mature brown adipocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and mature BAT.</p>",
                            "<p>Most studies have used mice as a model to study BAT development and function, due to the previously held view that adult humans did not possess BAT, as well as the limited access to human BAT from new born babies. As such, no study has looked at the miRNA profile of human BAT. It was therefore of interest to compare miRNA profiles of mouse and human BAT to establish the potential molecular similarities and differences between the two species. These comparisons also provide a snapshot of the potential to translate molecular observations from mice to humans. For the first time, a miRNA screening revealed the presence of 214 miRNAs expressed in human BAT, including 145 commonly expressed in mouse BAT. This screening also showed that 69 miRNAs expressed in human BAT were not expressed in mouse BAT and therefore were not taken into consideration when comparisons were made with the mouse model. Further investigations of these 69 miRNAs will be required to identify their potential unique role in human BAT development and function. In contrast, 181 miRNAs in mouse BAT were not present in human BAT, suggesting that translating results from mouse to human BAT needs careful consideration.</p>",
                            "<p>Of the 145 miRNAs common to both mouse and human BAT, 25 were identified in the list of 35 mouse BAT-enriched miRNAs potentially targeting genes involved in cellular growth, proliferation and development. 788 genes involved in these pathways were predicted to be targeted by these 25 miRNAs. In this present study, miR-20a was the only miRNA predicted to target <italic>MYF5</italic> and <italic>PPAR\u03b3</italic> (a previously experimentally observed target [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR38\">38</xref>]), two important factors directing cell fate towards a brown fat phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. In contrast, miR-20a is also predicted to target <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>BMPR2</italic>, a growth factor and receptor increased in white fat differentiation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>]. These findings suggest that miR-20a may have the capacity to control cell fate toward a brown or white fat phenotype. Furthermore, miR-20a was the miRNA targeting the second most numbers of genes (<italic>n</italic>\u2009=\u2009149) involved in growth and development, highlighting its potential importance in these pathways. To date, miR-20a has not been studied in relation to BAT growth and development and therefore requires further investigation.</p>",
                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",

                            "<p>miR-155, highly expressed in brown pre- adipocytes when compared to differentiated mature brown adipocytes, inhibits brown adipogenesis by targeting <italic>C/EBP\u03b2</italic> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR18\">18</xref>], a transcription factor forming a complex with PRDM16 during brown adipogenesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. In contrast to these observations, miR-155 was identified as a highly enriched miRNA in human and mouse BAT. This observation suggests that human BAT may be comprised of a mixed composition of cells with different stages of cell maturation. However, the presence of miR-20a, \u221225 and -30b, all predicted to inhibit expression of genes involved in brown fat development, may prevent the development of a \u201cclassical\u201d brown fat phenotype in human BAT. Furthermore, miR-182 and \u2212203 were also part of the top ten miRNAs targeting the most genes involved in growth and development in mouse BAT, suggesting their potentials roles in brown adipocyte development [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR21\">21</xref>]. However, only miR-203 was conserved in human BAT. The absence of miR-182 expression in human BAT might contribute to differences between mouse and human BAT development and function. A gene signature developed in human BAT identified a profile closely resembling a brite/beige phenotype [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR40\">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>]. This phenotype is supported by the absence of miR-378, a key regulator controlling classical BAT-specific expansion and obesity resistance [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. However the phenotypical signature may depend on the depth of the tissue taken with superficial tissue representing a more WAT-like signature while deeper tissue representing a more classical BAT-like signature [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR42\">42</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>The miR-193b-365 cluster and miR-455 are known to regulate mouse brown fat development and were identified in our selection of 25 BAT-enriched miRNAs common to mice and humans.

However, miR-193b null mice, that are also deficient in miR-365, have normal BAT development, differentiation and function [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>]. miR-193b null mice have elevated levels of miR-455 suggesting a compensatory effect in the absence of the miR-193b-365 cluster. miR-455 expression levels are also increased in mature murine brown adipocytes and positively correlate with uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) levels suggesting a potential metabolic role in brown adipocytes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. miR-19a, \u2212140, \u2212150 and -26b are predicted to target white fat-related genes (<italic>BMP2</italic> or <italic>BMPR2</italic> or <italic>HOXC9</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR39\">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR41\">41</xref>] and therefore may have a role in selecting cell fate toward brown adipogenesis.</p>",
