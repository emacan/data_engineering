Moreover, the extent of diversity can evolve over time and is different in different genes. The most striking changes in diversity occur in the envelope glycoproteins (Env). The initial transmission of HIV-1 can result in infection of the new host with multiple viruses expressing genetically diverse <italic>env </italic>sequences [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>]. Early in the evolution of infection, however, viruses expressing extremely homeogeneous <italic>env </italic>sequences become dominant, presumably reflecting the selection of viruses that are best adapted for replication in available target cells, and/or resistant to the nascent host immune response [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>].

The ability of these viruses, which express <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase in the place of Nef, to infect U373 cells stably expressing CD4 and either CCR5 (panel A) or CXCR4 (panel B) co-receptors was measured by evaluating luciferase expression in target cells 44 hours after infection.

The ability of all recombinant viruses to infect the two cell types was evaluated, but results are shown only for viruses that induced significant luciferase activity in the indicated target cell type [&gt;2 (RLU/sec)/(ng p24/ml)].

Indeed, the use of the homologous intracellular domain of gp41 led to a moderate loss in infectivity for the viruses from patient 4 and some viruses from patient 5, consistent with the possibility that incompatibilities existed in these cases between the gp41 sequences and the gag protein from pNL4-3.</p>",

The level of expression of both CD4 and CCR5 was approximately two-fold higher on U373-R5 cells than on MT4-R5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>). Thus, a possible explanation for these observations is that the infectivity of viruses for which a high ratio was observed are particularly sensitive to the levels of expression of CD4 and/or co-receptor, although other differences between U373-R5 cells and MT4-R5 cells may also influence the ability of viruses carrying different envelopes to infect these cell types.</p>",

In addition to the functional diversity observed among viruses from a single patient, significant inter-patient differences were also observed for some characteristics of Env proteins, including sensitivity to several different entry inhibitors and the relative ability of viruses to infect different target cells. Interestingly, no correlation was observed between viral infectivity and sensitivity to entry inhibitors, indicating that these properties are, to some extent, dissociable. These findings demonstrate the marked functional heterogeneity of HIV-1 Env proteins expressed by contemporaneous circulating viruses, and underscore the advantage of clonal analyses in characterizing such viral populations.</p>",
                            "<p>The high mutation and recombination rates of HIV-1 are also likely to have an important impact on infectivity. Because of the numerous structural constraints in viral proteins, including Env, many mutations will prove to be deleterious for fitness.

In this regard, we observed that 3 of 4 viruses in which V3 sequences contained a single amino acid polymorphism not seen in any other sequence from that patient had low infectivity. The association of such rare polymorphisms with poor infectivity is consistent with the possibility that the deleterious mutations contribute to the wide spectrum infectivity observed in these studies, although further studies are required to directly demonstrate the impact of such specific genetic differences on viral infectivity.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action.

First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity.

The affinity of Env-coreceptor interactions is one factor that can influence both Env fusion kinetics and the sensitivity of Env to the inhibition by enfuvirtide and TAK-779 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>], although mutations that modify sensitivity to co-receptor antagonists without modifying fusion kinetics have also been described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>]. The failure to find a correlation between Env infectivity and sensitivity to these inhibitors suggests that differences affecting membrane fusion that are independent of Env-coreceptor affinity (e.g., \"fusogenicity\") or differences affecting other Env properties (e.g., the expression or stability of Env trimers) make an important contribution to the wide spectrum of Env infectivities observed in this study.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action.

For patient 2, clonal viruses were obtained from plasma samples obtained 8 months apart (26 and 34 months after initial diagnosis).

The level of expression of both CD4 and CCR5 was approximately two-fold higher on U373-R5 cells than on MT4-R5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>). Thus, a possible explanation for these observations is that the infectivity of viruses for which a high ratio was observed are particularly sensitive to the levels of expression of CD4 and/or co-receptor, although other differences between U373-R5 cells and MT4-R5 cells may also influence the ability of viruses carrying different envelopes to infect these cell types.</p>",

The amino acid sequence of the V3 region of these dual-tropic clones from patients 1 and 2 differed at 6 and 1 positions, respectively, compared to that of the most similar R5-tropic Env identified in that patient, and these differences may explain the change in tropism.

                            "<p>The extent that genetic differences deleterious for viral replication accumulate because they are associated with escape from immune responses is also an important issue. In this regard, we observed that a V2 haplotype associated with reduced viral infectivity emerged in patient 2 over an 8 month interval, and had become the dominant haplotype. This haplotype differed by a single amino acid change from another haplotype observed in this individual (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>). Such a modification would be typical of escape from neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells targeting this epitope, although other explanations are also possible (e.g., adaptation of the Env proteins to improve the targeting of a specific cell type or fixation of a deleterious mutation through stochastic processes). Further studies comparing the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins present in the genetically homogeneous viral populations of viruses present immediately before seroconversion with that observed following the development of the anti-viral immune response will help define the extent that selection of variants associated with immune escape affects Env function.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action.

The failure to find a correlation between Env infectivity and sensitivity to these inhibitors suggests that differences affecting membrane fusion that are independent of Env-coreceptor affinity (e.g., \"fusogenicity\") or differences affecting other Env properties (e.g., the expression or stability of Env trimers) make an important contribution to the wide spectrum of Env infectivities observed in this study.</p>",

The level of expression of both CD4 and CCR5 was approximately two-fold higher on U373-R5 cells than on MT4-R5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>). Thus, a possible explanation for these observations is that the infectivity of viruses for which a high ratio was observed are particularly sensitive to the levels of expression of CD4 and/or co-receptor, although other differences between U373-R5 cells and MT4-R5 cells may also influence the ability of viruses carrying different envelopes to infect these cell types.</p>",

Three of the 6 Env proteins with dual tropism, however, were predicted to exhibit R5-exclusive tropism (one clone each from patients 1, 2 and 5). The amino acid sequence of the V3 region of these dual-tropic clones from patients 1 and 2 differed at 6 and 1 positions, respectively, compared to that of the most similar R5-tropic Env identified in that patient, and these differences may explain the change in tropism. The V3 region of the misidentified dual-tropic envelope sequence from patient 5, however, was identical to that of other Env with R5-exclusive tropism, indicating that sequences outside V3 influenced the tropism of this Env.</p>",
                            "<p>In general, viruses with strict R5-tropism from the same individual expressed a relatively small number of haplotypes within a given variable (V) region. For example, the number of distinct haplotypes identified for the V3 region ranged from 1 (patient 1) to 4 (patient 2). Significant differences in the infectivity of R5-tropic viruses as a function of haplotype were observed for the variable regions 2 and 3 (V2 and V3) of patient 2 (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.03 respectively using the Kruskal-Wallis test). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>, the viruses from this patient expressing V3 region haplotypes 2 and 3 were significantly less infectious than those expressing haplotype 1 (p &lt; 0.01 using the Mann-Whitney test), and viruses expressing the V2 region haplotype 4 were less infectious than those expressing the V2 region haplotypes 1 \u2013 3 (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the viruses expressing the V2 haplotype associated with low infectivity (haplotype 4) also expressed V3 haplotypes associated with low infectivity. However, one of the viruses expressed this V2 haplotype in association with the V3 haplotype 1, which was usually associated with good infectivity (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8A</xref>). The infectivity of this virus was, nevertheless, low (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8B</xref>), suggesting that expression of the V2 haplotype 4 was a major determinant for low infectivity in this patient. It is noteworthy that clones from patient 2 expressing the V2 haplotype 4 were obtained only from the plasma sample obtained at month 34, and 9/13 clones with R5-tropism isolated at this time point expressed this V2 haplotype.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>An interesting observation from our study was the absence of correlation between the infectivity of the recombinant viruses studied and their susceptibility to several different entry inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies. The affinity of Env-coreceptor interactions is one factor that can influence both Env fusion kinetics and the sensitivity of Env to the inhibition by enfuvirtide and TAK-779 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>], although mutations that modify sensitivity to co-receptor antagonists without modifying fusion kinetics have also been described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>]. The failure to find a correlation between Env infectivity and sensitivity to these inhibitors suggests that differences affecting membrane fusion that are independent of Env-coreceptor affinity (e.g., \"fusogenicity\") or differences affecting other Env properties (e.g., the expression or stability of Env trimers) make an important contribution to the wide spectrum of Env infectivities observed in this study.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action. Our findings suggest, however, that resistance to entry inhibitors is not likely to be a useful surrogate marker for viral infectivity.</p>",

Most of the viruses expressing the V2 haplotype associated with low infectivity (haplotype 4) also expressed V3 haplotypes associated with low infectivity.

The infectivity of this virus was, nevertheless, low (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8B</xref>), suggesting that expression of the V2 haplotype 4 was a major determinant for low infectivity in this patient.

Indeed, the use of the homologous intracellular domain of gp41 led to a moderate loss in infectivity for the viruses from patient 4 and some viruses from patient 5, consistent with the possibility that incompatibilities existed in these cases between the gp41 sequences and the gag protein from pNL4-3.</p>",

The recombinant viruses carrying 3 of these unique V3 polymorphisms had the lowest infectivity for U373-R5 cells of any virus evaluated from that sample.</p>",
                            "<p>The high mutation and recombination rates of HIV-1 are also likely to have an important impact on infectivity.

In this regard, we observed that 3 of 4 viruses in which V3 sequences contained a single amino acid polymorphism not seen in any other sequence from that patient had low infectivity. The association of such rare polymorphisms with poor infectivity is consistent with the possibility that the deleterious mutations contribute to the wide spectrum infectivity observed in these studies, although further studies are required to directly demonstrate the impact of such specific genetic differences on viral infectivity.</p>",
                            "<p>The possibility that viral evolution during in vitro culture contributed to diversity should also be considered. For example, greatest viral diversity was observed for patient 3, and clones from this patient emerged later than those from the other patients. However, control experiments (see Materials and Methods) showed no evidence for viral evolution during culture. In particular, the absence of polymorphic bases in the sequences of the viral clones indicates that variants were not emerging to the extent that they were detectable by bulk sequencing, and therefore were not sufficiently abundant to influence either viral diversity or the assessment of infectivity.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study.

We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity.

The ability of these viruses to infect U373-R5 cells was compared by evaluating luciferase expression in the target cells 44 hours after infection. The infectivity of each pair of viruses was evaluated in three independent experiments, and each symbol represents the mean of these determinations. The dotted line is the line of identity.

The level of expression of both CD4 and CCR5 was approximately two-fold higher on U373-R5 cells than on MT4-R5 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F6\">6</xref>). Thus, a possible explanation for these observations is that the infectivity of viruses for which a high ratio was observed are particularly sensitive to the levels of expression of CD4 and/or co-receptor, although other differences between U373-R5 cells and MT4-R5 cells may also influence the ability of viruses carrying different envelopes to infect these cell types.</p>",

The amino acid sequence of the V3 region of these dual-tropic clones from patients 1 and 2 differed at 6 and 1 positions, respectively, compared to that of the most similar R5-tropic Env identified in that patient, and these differences may explain the change in tropism. The V3 region of the misidentified dual-tropic envelope sequence from patient 5, however, was identical to that of other Env with R5-exclusive tropism, indicating that sequences outside V3 influenced the tropism of this Env.</p>",

                            "<p>The observation that Env proteins expressed by contemporaneous viruses display a broad spectrum of infectivity towards a given target cell raises the question of the forces responsible for this functional diversity. One factor that can drive the development of diversity is the selection in a single patient of numerous viral subpopulations with distinct Env functional properties. Genetically distinct viral populations replicating in different tissues or cellular compartments have been identified in numerous studies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>]. Such populations can also result in functional diversity, as illustrated by the obvious example of the coexistence of viruses with different tropism. Indeed, we found that the coexistence of viruses with R5 and X4 tropism could make an important contribution to overall genetic diversity in patients from whom both populations were isolated.</p>",
                            "<p>The high mutation and recombination rates of HIV-1 are also likely to have an important impact on infectivity. Because of the numerous structural constraints in viral proteins, including Env, many mutations will prove to be deleterious for fitness. Similarly, recombination events that shuffle <italic>env </italic>segments can modify the function of Env proteins [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B55\">55</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>]. Indeed, genetic evidence supports the idea that purifying selection against deleterious mutations is occurring in the <italic>env </italic>region [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B57\">57</xref>]. In this regard, we observed that 3 of 4 viruses in which V3 sequences contained a single amino acid polymorphism not seen in any other sequence from that patient had low infectivity. The association of such rare polymorphisms with poor infectivity is consistent with the possibility that the deleterious mutations contribute to the wide spectrum infectivity observed in these studies, although further studies are required to directly demonstrate the impact of such specific genetic differences on viral infectivity.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action. Our findings suggest, however, that resistance to entry inhibitors is not likely to be a useful surrogate marker for viral infectivity.</p>",

In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>An interesting observation from our study was the absence of correlation between the infectivity of the recombinant viruses studied and their susceptibility to several different entry inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies. The affinity of Env-coreceptor interactions is one factor that can influence both Env fusion kinetics and the sensitivity of Env to the inhibition by enfuvirtide and TAK-779 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B35\">35</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B56\">56</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>], although mutations that modify sensitivity to co-receptor antagonists without modifying fusion kinetics have also been described [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B36\">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B60\">60</xref>]. The failure to find a correlation between Env infectivity and sensitivity to these inhibitors suggests that differences affecting membrane fusion that are independent of Env-coreceptor affinity (e.g., \"fusogenicity\") or differences affecting other Env properties (e.g., the expression or stability of Env trimers) make an important contribution to the wide spectrum of Env infectivities observed in this study.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action. Our findings suggest, however, that resistance to entry inhibitors is not likely to be a useful surrogate marker for viral infectivity.</p>",

To avoid potential incompatibilities between these viral proteins [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B44\">44</xref>], we initially evaluated the infectivity of recombinant viruses in which both the intracellular portion of gp41 and Gag were derived from the pNL4-3 viral strain.

To do so, we compared the infectivity of selected recombinant viruses in which the intracellular domain of gp41 was derived either from pNL4-3 or from the primary viral isolate. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>, the infectivities of the two constructs were strongly correlated (Spearman r = 0.86; p &lt; 0.0001).

Indeed, the use of the homologous intracellular domain of gp41 led to a moderate loss in infectivity for the viruses from patient 4 and some viruses from patient 5, consistent with the possibility that incompatibilities existed in these cases between the gp41 sequences and the gag protein from pNL4-3.</p>",

The ability of these viruses to infect U373-R5 cells was compared by evaluating luciferase expression in the target cells 44 hours after infection.

                            "<p>In general, viruses with strict R5-tropism from the same individual expressed a relatively small number of haplotypes within a given variable (V) region. For example, the number of distinct haplotypes identified for the V3 region ranged from 1 (patient 1) to 4 (patient 2). Significant differences in the infectivity of R5-tropic viruses as a function of haplotype were observed for the variable regions 2 and 3 (V2 and V3) of patient 2 (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.03 respectively using the Kruskal-Wallis test). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>, the viruses from this patient expressing V3 region haplotypes 2 and 3 were significantly less infectious than those expressing haplotype 1 (p &lt; 0.01 using the Mann-Whitney test), and viruses expressing the V2 region haplotype 4 were less infectious than those expressing the V2 region haplotypes 1 \u2013 3 (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the viruses expressing the V2 haplotype associated with low infectivity (haplotype 4) also expressed V3 haplotypes associated with low infectivity. However, one of the viruses expressed this V2 haplotype in association with the V3 haplotype 1, which was usually associated with good infectivity (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8A</xref>). The infectivity of this virus was, nevertheless, low (red arrow in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8B</xref>), suggesting that expression of the V2 haplotype 4 was a major determinant for low infectivity in this patient. It is noteworthy that clones from patient 2 expressing the V2 haplotype 4 were obtained only from the plasma sample obtained at month 34, and 9/13 clones with R5-tropism isolated at this time point expressed this V2 haplotype.</p>",
                            "<p>The extent that genetic differences deleterious for viral replication accumulate because they are associated with escape from immune responses is also an important issue. In this regard, we observed that a V2 haplotype associated with reduced viral infectivity emerged in patient 2 over an 8 month interval, and had become the dominant haplotype. This haplotype differed by a single amino acid change from another haplotype observed in this individual (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>). Such a modification would be typical of escape from neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells targeting this epitope, although other explanations are also possible (e.g., adaptation of the Env proteins to improve the targeting of a specific cell type or fixation of a deleterious mutation through stochastic processes). Further studies comparing the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins present in the genetically homogeneous viral populations of viruses present immediately before seroconversion with that observed following the development of the anti-viral immune response will help define the extent that selection of variants associated with immune escape affects Env function.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action. Our findings suggest, however, that resistance to entry inhibitors is not likely to be a useful surrogate marker for viral infectivity.</p>",

Early in the evolution of infection, however, viruses expressing extremely homeogeneous <italic>env </italic>sequences become dominant, presumably reflecting the selection of viruses that are best adapted for replication in available target cells, and/or resistant to the nascent host immune response [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. This initial homogenization is followed by a period often lasting many years, in which both the diversity of the <italic>env </italic>sequences and the evolutionary distance from the initially dominant strain increase linearly by approximately 1% per year [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>].

As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>, the viruses from this patient expressing V3 region haplotypes 2 and 3 were significantly less infectious than those expressing haplotype 1 (p &lt; 0.01 using the Mann-Whitney test), and viruses expressing the V2 region haplotype 4 were less infectious than those expressing the V2 region haplotypes 1 \u2013 3 (p &lt; 0.001). Most of the viruses expressing the V2 haplotype associated with low infectivity (haplotype 4) also expressed V3 haplotypes associated with low infectivity.

                            "<p>The extent that genetic differences deleterious for viral replication accumulate because they are associated with escape from immune responses is also an important issue. In this regard, we observed that a V2 haplotype associated with reduced viral infectivity emerged in patient 2 over an 8 month interval, and had become the dominant haplotype. This haplotype differed by a single amino acid change from another haplotype observed in this individual (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F8\">8</xref>). Such a modification would be typical of escape from neutralizing antibodies or cytotoxic T-cells targeting this epitope, although other explanations are also possible (e.g., adaptation of the Env proteins to improve the targeting of a specific cell type or fixation of a deleterious mutation through stochastic processes). Further studies comparing the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins present in the genetically homogeneous viral populations of viruses present immediately before seroconversion with that observed following the development of the anti-viral immune response will help define the extent that selection of variants associated with immune escape affects Env function.</p>",
                            "<p>The spectrum of Env infectivity in vivo is almost certainly greater than observed in our study. The Env proteins studied by us were derived from viruses capable of productively infecting MT4-R5 cells. We must assume that the <italic>env </italic>sequences of these viruses were enriched for those with high infectivity in this cell system, and Env proteins carrying lethal mutations or mutations preventing efficient propagation in MT4-R5 cell cultures would not be sampled. We found that recombinant viruses produced using bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified directly from plasma by RT-PCR had an infectivity that was lower than that of recombinant viruses carrying Env proteins from the clonal viruses derived from the same sample, as would be expected if a significant proportion of viruses present in plasma carry Env proteins that are noninfectious or whose infectivity is too low to permit emergence of clones during in vitro culture. The finding in previous studies that a substantial portion of viruses expressing <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR show low or undetectable infectivity is also compatible with this interpretation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. It should be emphasized, however, that additional artifacts may also contribute to the low infectivity observed in our study for viruses carrying bulk <italic>env </italic>sequences amplified from plasma by RT-PCR, such that the infectivity of the recombinant viruses would not be reflective of viruses in plasma. First, recombinant viruses formed using mixtures of sequences amplified from plasma will express heterotrimeric Env proteins, including, for some samples, trimers containing sequences with both X4 and R5 tropism. In this regard, our preliminary results suggest that the infectivity of viruses generated using mixtures of clonal <italic>env </italic>sequences may be lower than the mean infectivity of viruses expressing each of these <italic>env </italic>sequences as homotrimers. In addition, during the amplification of <italic>env </italic>sequences from plasma, recombination between the heterogeneous target sequences can occur, and may form sequences in which incompatibilities between Env segments are deleterious to infectivity. In view of these uncertainties, further studies will be required to fully define the spectrum of infectivity of Env proteins expressed by viruses in plasma.</p>",
                            "<p>We did observe, however, that sensitivity to inhibition by soluble CD4, enfuvirtide, and three different neutralizing antibodies were properties that were shared by viruses from a given patient, independent of their infectivity. Similarly, Ray et al. found differences in enfuvirtide sensitivity comparing Env clones isolated from different patients [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. These findings suggest that genetic determinants important in defining the sensitivity to these entry inhibitors lie in regions that are not necessarily subject to extensive diversity. For example, determinants in the relatively well conserved membrane proximal ectodomain of gp41 appear to be important in determining sensitivity to both enfuvirtide and the monoclonal antibody 2F5 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Determinants of sensitivity to inhibitors of coreceptor binding appear to be subject to greater intra-patient variability. No patient-specific differences in sensitivity to TAK-779 was observed in our study, and considerable variability in sensitivity of individual Env clones from a given patient has been reported for several other coreceptor antagonists [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B58\">58</xref>]. Thus, the impact of viral diversity on sensitivity to entry inhibitors is likely to differ for inhibitors with different modes of action.
