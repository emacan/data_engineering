        "abstract": "<p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that <italic>Vibrio scophthalmi</italic>, the most abundant <italic>Vibrio</italic> species among the marine aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria inhabiting the intestinal tract of healthy cultured turbot (<italic>Scophthalmus maximus</italic>), contains at least two quorum-sensing circuits involving two types of signal molecules (a 3-hydroxy-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone and the universal autoinducer 2 encoded by <italic>luxS</italic>). The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions regulated by these quorum sensing circuits in this vibrio by constructing mutants for the genes involved in these circuits.</p>\n<p>The presence of a homologue to the <italic>Vibrio harveyi luxR</italic> gene encoding a main transcriptional regulator, whose expression is modulated by quorum\u2013sensing signal molecules in other vibrios, was detected and sequenced. The <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic> LuxR protein displayed a maximum amino acid identity of 82% with SmcR, the LuxR homologue found in <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>. <italic>luxR</italic> and <italic>luxS</italic> null mutants were constructed and their phenotype analysed. Both mutants displayed reduced biofilm formation <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as differences in membrane protein expression by mass-spectrometry analysis. Additionally, a recombinant strain of <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic> carrying the lactonase AiiA from <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, which causes hydrolysis of acyl homoserine lactones, was included in the study.</p>\n<p><italic>V. scophthalmi</italic> shares two quorum sensing circuits, including the main transcriptional regulator <italic>luxR</italic>, with some pathogenic vibrios such as <italic>V. harveyi</italic> and <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>. However, contrary to these pathogenic vibrios no virulence factors (such as protease production) were found to be quorum sensing regulated in this bacterium. Noteworthy, biofilm formation was altered in <italic>luxS</italic> and <italic>luxR</italic> mutants. In these mutants a different expression profile of membrane proteins were observed with respect to the wild type strain suggesting that quorum sensing could play a role in the regulation of the adhesion mechanisms of this bacterium.</p>",

Once the signalling molecule has reached a critical concentration, the quorum-sensing regulon is activated and the bacteria elicit a particular response as a population.</p>",

LuxI synthesizes a diffusible signal molecule, N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), which increases in concentration as the cell density increases. LuxR, the transcriptional activator of the bioluminescence <italic>lux</italic> operon, binds 3-oxo-C6-HSL, which increases its stability. This complex binds the promoter of the <italic>lux</italic> operon activating the production of light. The LuxI-LuxR quorum-sensing circuit is found in many Gram-negative bacteria and has been shown to regulate a variety of genes; for instance, it has been shown to regulate virulence in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>].

                            "<p>In <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> three additional quorum-sensing circuits were characterized that respond to three different signal molecules (see\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], for review). The first quorum-sensing system is composed of an AHL synthase, LuxM, which is responsible for the synthesis of 3-hydroxy-C4-HSL, and the receptor LuxN, a hybrid sensor kinase (present in <italic>V. harveyi, Vibrio anguillarum</italic> and <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic>, among others). The second is composed of LuxS, LuxP and LuxQ. LuxS is responsible for the synthesis of the autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a universal signaling molecule used both by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for interspecies communication\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], LuxP is a periplasmic protein that binds AI-2 and LuxQ is a hybrid sensor kinase. The third system is composed of CqsA and CqsS. CqsA is responsible for the synthesis of a different autoinducer, the cholerae autoinducer CAI-I\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>], and CqsS is the hybrid sensor kinase<italic>.</italic> These three quorum-sensing systems converge via phosphorelay signal transduction to a single regulator LuxO, which is activated upon phosphorylation at low cell density. LuxR, a regulatory protein that shares no homology to the <italic>V. fischeri</italic> LuxR, activates bioluminescence, biofilm formation, and metalloprotease and siderophore production at high cell density, is at the end of this cascade\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. This regulatory protein is repressed at low cell density and derepressed at high cell density in the presence of autoinducers which, after binding, activate the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinases. This more complex quorum-sensing system is found predominately in <italic>Vibrio</italic> species and components of the network vary between species\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>].</p>",

However, there is still a lack of knowledge of the bacterial activities that are regulated by quorum-sensing in this bacterium. In this study, we identified a homologue of the <italic>V. harveyi luxR</italic> transcriptional regulator and analyzed the functions regulated by LuxR and the previously identified quorum-sensing signaling molecules by constructing mutants for the coding genes.</p>",

                            "<p>In contrast, quorum-sensing was shown to positively regulate biofilm formation <italic>in vitro</italic> since both <italic>luxR</italic> and <italic>luxS</italic> null mutants had altered biofilm formation (Figure\n<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>). Noticeably, biofilm was only formed when bacteria were grown in MB medium in either the mutant or the wild-type strains and abolished when bacteria were cultured in TSB2 (data not shown). MB medium is used to culture heterotrophic marine bacteria and mimics the marine salt concentration and, although TSB also allowed growth of the bacterium, for some reason the differences in salt concentration or in nutrient or carbohydrate contents exerted an effect on biofilm formation. In order to investigate a possible effect of catabolite repression, we supplemented MB with glucose 0.5% and 1% w/v which resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation. On the other hand, over-expression of <italic>luxR</italic> decreased the amount of biofilm, perhaps due to the decrease in the growth rate caused by the deregulation of <italic>luxR</italic>, as stated above.

In <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic>, these two quorum-sensing systems may play a role in the colonization and establishment of this bacterium in the fish intestine, since it is a normal inhabitant of the turbot intestine\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].

Interestingly, in a recent study on quorum-sensing in <italic>V. ichthyoenteri</italic> (the most closely related species to <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic>), its <italic>luxS</italic> homologue was sequenced and a mutant for this gene constructed, but no functions were reported to be regulated by this gene\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. It has to be noted that neither the <italic>V. ichthyoenteri</italic> wild type, nor the <italic>luxS</italic> mutant formed biofilms in the microwell plates. Our results showed that <italic>luxS</italic> is involved in biofilm formation at least <italic>in vitro</italic> in <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic>. However, it is important to highlight that in our study the <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic> wild-type strain was only able to form significant biofilm when grown in MB, while TSB inhibited biofilm formation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess if <italic>V. ichthyoenteri</italic> and the <italic>luxS</italic> mutant behave similarly to <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic> since they are so closely related. In <italic>V. scophthalmi</italic>, these two quorum-sensing systems may play a role in the colonization and establishment of this bacterium in the fish intestine, since it is a normal inhabitant of the turbot intestine\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. In fact most vibrio species form biofilms on different structures, which is believed to be beneficial for the populations against different environmental stresses\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>].

On the other hand, siderophore production, which has been shown to be regulated by quorum-sensing in other vibrios was evaluated using the siderophore CAS assay. In addition, the ability to grow in iron depleted medium (EDDA assay) was assessed. A minor positive signal indicating the presence of siderophore activity was detected in all the mutants and wild type strains with the same intensity. However, neither the wild-type strain nor the mutants grew in the EDDA-supplemented medium suggesting that this species is not able to grow in iron-depleted medium, at least under the conditions used in the assay. Extracellular proteases and siderophores are often produced by pathogenic vibrios\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>], although some vibrios that are not pathogenic have been shown to produce siderophores in an iron-limited host environment, such as <italic>V. fischeri</italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>].</p>",

LuxS is responsible for the synthesis of the autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a universal signaling molecule used both by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for interspecies communication\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], LuxP is a periplasmic protein that binds AI-2 and LuxQ is a hybrid sensor kinase. The third system is composed of CqsA and CqsS. CqsA is responsible for the synthesis of a different autoinducer, the cholerae autoinducer CAI-I\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>], and CqsS is the hybrid sensor kinase<italic>.</italic> These three quorum-sensing systems converge via phosphorelay signal transduction to a single regulator LuxO, which is activated upon phosphorylation at low cell density. LuxR, a regulatory protein that shares no homology to the <italic>V. fischeri</italic> LuxR, activates bioluminescence, biofilm formation, and metalloprotease and siderophore production at high cell density, is at the end of this cascade\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. This regulatory protein is repressed at low cell density and derepressed at high cell density in the presence of autoinducers which, after binding, activate the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinases. This more complex quorum-sensing system is found predominately in <italic>Vibrio</italic> species and components of the network vary between species\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>].</p>",

Noticeably, biofilm was only formed when bacteria were grown in MB medium in either the mutant or the wild-type strains and abolished when bacteria were cultured in TSB2 (data not shown). MB medium is used to culture heterotrophic marine bacteria and mimics the marine salt concentration and, although TSB also allowed growth of the bacterium, for some reason the differences in salt concentration or in nutrient or carbohydrate contents exerted an effect on biofilm formation. In order to investigate a possible effect of catabolite repression, we supplemented MB with glucose 0.5% and 1% w/v which resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation. On the other hand, over-expression of <italic>luxR</italic> decreased the amount of biofilm, perhaps due to the decrease in the growth rate caused by the deregulation of <italic>luxR</italic>, as stated above. In the case of <italic>luxS</italic> overexpression no differences were found between the over-expressed <italic>luxS</italic> and the control strain carrying pMMB207 plasmid.

The second is composed of LuxS, LuxP and LuxQ. LuxS is responsible for the synthesis of the autoinducer 2 (AI-2), a universal signaling molecule used both by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for interspecies communication\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>], LuxP is a periplasmic protein that binds AI-2 and LuxQ is a hybrid sensor kinase.

LuxR, a regulatory protein that shares no homology to the <italic>V. fischeri</italic> LuxR, activates bioluminescence, biofilm formation, and metalloprotease and siderophore production at high cell density, is at the end of this cascade\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>]. This regulatory protein is repressed at low cell density and derepressed at high cell density in the presence of autoinducers which, after binding, activate the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinases.

Additionally, the ability of these strains to grow on iron depleted media was assessed using MA and TSA2 plates containing 0.2 mM ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (EDDA) chelating agent.</p>"
