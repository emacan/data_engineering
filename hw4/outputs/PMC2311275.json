In particular, the\nregulations involving metabolite pools are often neglected. However,\nmetabolite pools link the metabolic to the genetic network through genetic\nregulations, including those involving effectors of transcription factors or\nriboswitches. Consequently, they play pivotal roles in the global\norganization of the genetic and metabolic regulatory networks.</p>\n\n<p>We report the manually curated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic\nregulatory networks of the central metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis </italic>(transcriptional,\ntranslational and post-translational regulations and modulation of enzymatic\nactivities). We provide a systematic graphic representation of regulations\nof each metabolic pathway based on the central role of metabolites in\nregulation. We show that the complex regulatory network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis </italic>can be decomposed as sets of locally regulated modules,\nwhich are coordinated by global regulators.</p>\n\n<p>This work reveals the strong involvement of metabolite pools in the general\nregulation of the metabolic network.

Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch. The absence of GMP synthesis would then prevent\nthe growth of the <italic>hprT </italic>mutant even in LB medium. Of course,\nthis prediction remains to be tested experimentally.</p>\n",

The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch. The absence of GMP synthesis would then prevent\nthe growth of the <italic>hprT </italic>mutant even in LB medium. Of course,\nthis prediction remains to be tested experimentally.</p>\n",

However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR).

CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA.

However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes.

                            "<p>Using this model, we were able to examine various aspects of the general organization\nof metabolic regulation. We find that metabolite pools are strongly involved in\nregulation of the central metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, in\nagreement with the findings from an analysis of the genetic regulatory network of <italic>Escherichia\ncoli </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Moreover, by introducing\nthe notion of local and global regulation, we reveal that the complex regulatory\nnetwork can be broken down into sets of locally regulated modules, which are\ncoordinated by global regulators. Local regulations ensure that the control of\nelementary pathways through genetic and/or enzymatic regulation depends upon the\nlevel of key metabolites. The regulation of tryptophan synthesis by tryptophan\nthrough the TRAP regulatory protein is an example of such a local regulation. In\ncontrast, global regulations ensure the coordination between these elementary\npathways in response to environmental changes. For example, CcpA inhibits several\npathways during glycolytic growth conditions. The integration of these local/global\nlevels and the use of the classification of sensing signals in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] lead to recover the main physiological\naspects of metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Finally, the notion of\nlocal and global regulation allows the graphic representation of any metabolic\npathway and its various regulatory mechanisms.</p>\n",

Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition).

Our model includes the biochemical reactions of the\nmetabolic network and all the known levels of regulation involved in metabolic\npathways: transcriptional, translational, post-translational and modulation of\nenzymatic activities. To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch.

                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR). The remaining genetic\nregulators are ArfM, Spo0A, SpoVT, SpoIIID, GerE, CcpB and Spx.</p>\n",
                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5).

CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

CcpA directly regulates\ncarbohydrates, fatty-acids and amino acids degradation (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S6\">6</xref>, Table S3 for\ndetails).

To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch.

                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5). YycF is indirectly involved in the regulation\nof metabolic pathways (respiration and fermentation) via a cascade of\nregulations involving PhoP, ResD, FNR and ArfM. CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

This control of a pathway as a function of the pool\nof effector metabolite was termed \"local regulation\". In turn, the set of\nenzymes associated with a local regulation and the local regulators define a\nfunctional \"elementary module\" (see details in the Discussion). For example,\nthe enzymes TrpE, TrpG, TrpD, TrpF TrpC, TrpA, TrpB involved in the\ntryptophan synthesis together with the regulators TRAP, RtpA, the\ntryptophan-specific T-box and the tryptophan-rich peptide leader Plead\ndefine an elementary module (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S26). Indeed\nthe enzymatic complex TrpE+TrpG is regulated by TRAP at the genetic level,\nand by tryptophan at the enzymatic level. This elementary module definition\nis based on the mathematical developments given in Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>, which describes the\nkey control properties associated to local regulations (according to our\ndefinition). Elementary modules have been manually identified during the\ncurated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis </italic>by a strict application of the local regulation\ndefinition. Global regulators of a metabolic pathway are defined as any\nnon-local regulators involved in the control of this pathway.

They mainly correspond to level 2 to 5 regulators.\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref>\npresents the local/global classification of all genetic regulators of the\nreconstructed regulatory network.

Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

                            "<p>Using this model, we were able to examine various aspects of the general organization\nof metabolic regulation. We find that metabolite pools are strongly involved in\nregulation of the central metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, in\nagreement with the findings from an analysis of the genetic regulatory network of <italic>Escherichia\ncoli </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>]. Moreover, by introducing\nthe notion of local and global regulation, we reveal that the complex regulatory\nnetwork can be broken down into sets of locally regulated modules, which are\ncoordinated by global regulators. Local regulations ensure that the control of\nelementary pathways through genetic and/or enzymatic regulation depends upon the\nlevel of key metabolites. The regulation of tryptophan synthesis by tryptophan\nthrough the TRAP regulatory protein is an example of such a local regulation. In\ncontrast, global regulations ensure the coordination between these elementary\npathways in response to environmental changes. For example, CcpA inhibits several\npathways during glycolytic growth conditions. The integration of these local/global\nlevels and the use of the classification of sensing signals in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] lead to recover the main physiological\naspects of metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. Finally, the notion of\nlocal and global regulation allows the graphic representation of any metabolic\npathway and its various regulatory mechanisms.</p>\n",
                            "<p>The model was built from the reconstruction of these main metabolic pathways (see\nMethods). It corresponds to a so-called knowledge-based model describing the\nchemical reactions, known transcriptional, translational and post-translational\nregulations and controls of enzymatic activities. In contrast to classic\nrepresentations of genetic regulatory networks that integrate only regulation by\ntranscription factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], we have also\nincorporated transcriptional regulations by premature termination of\ntranscription. The translational and post-translational regulations correspond\nto regulation (<italic>i</italic>) by sequestration of the Ribosome Binding\nSequence (RBS); (<italic>ii</italic>) by small non-coding RNA; (<italic>iii</italic>)\nby sequestration of proteins and (<italic>iv</italic>) by proteolysis. We also\nsystematically included (<italic>i</italic>) a description of enzymatic\ncomplexes, which are represented as a sum of genes, (<italic>ii</italic>)\ngenetic organization in operons, and (<italic>iii</italic>) the number of\npromoters for each gene and the detailed conditions of transcription from each\npromoter (see Methods). The final model includes 534 genes, 563 reactions, 65\ntranscription factors (TF), 9 sigma factors and 21 other mechanisms of genetic\nregulation at the transcriptional or translational level (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). The model also includes 95 different\ngenetic regulations involving either transcription factors (and sigma factors)\nor other mechanisms. This model provides a basis for future developments of\ndynamic models.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Because our model integrates information that has been confirmed by\nexperiments with the exception of fermentation and degradation of\nbranched-chain amino acids, its validation and its biological relevance are\nintrinsic. However, it is interesting to assess whether our model recovers\nknown phenotypes of <italic>B. subtilis </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>\n,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch. The absence of GMP synthesis would then prevent\nthe growth of the <italic>hprT </italic>mutant even in LB medium. Of course,\nthis prediction remains to be tested experimentally.</p>\n",

Here, we propose a definition for the metabolic\nnetwork based on the <italic>in vivo </italic>behaviour of regulations through\nmetabolites: a functional \"<bold>elementary module\" </bold>corresponds to (<italic>\ni</italic>) a set of enzymes, which are either regulated by a local regulation,\nor constitutive (without direct local regulations) and located in the pathway\nbetween the key metabolite and the first locally controlled enzyme and (<italic>\nii</italic>) the associated local regulator(s). This definition combines both\nthe genetic and the metabolic levels through the feedback of metabolites on\nenzymes and genes via enzymatic regulations and effectors of genetic regulators,\nwhile other definitions of module are based solely on the genetic level and\nclustering [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B59\">59</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B61\">61</xref>].</p>\n",

In these conditions, the laws of pathway induction\ncan be described by Boolean logic conditions, which are easy to manipulate\nand to simulate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>]. Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

                            "<p>Recently, the reconstruction and analysis of genome-scale genetic and metabolic\nregulatory networks has become an area of active research. It requires the\nintegration of existing knowledge as a first step towards systems biology, which we\ndefine as the study of the interactions between the components of biological systems\nto understand how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of the\nsystem. Genetic and metabolic networks have been constructed for <italic>Helicobacter\npylori </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>], <italic>Haemophilus\ninfluenzae </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>], <italic>Lactococcus\nlactis </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>], <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B4\">4</xref>], and <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>], by incorporating the description of chemical\nreactions into a stoichiometric matrix. Transcriptional regulation by regulatory\nproteins has been included in the last update of the model of <italic>Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B6\">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>]. However, most of these models do not explicitly include\nregulation mediated by metabolites, with the exception of the most recent version of\nthe EcoCyc database [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>]. Metabolites can\nmodulate the activity of transcription factors and enzymes and are therefore key\nregulators.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Reconstruction of the metabolic network and its associated regulatory network\ncontributes to resolving various problems such as unravelling how the bacterium\ncoordinates its genetic and metabolic networks to adapt to environmental changes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] and\nelucidating the global organization of the regulatory network [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>]. Such work will\nalso help develop tools and concepts to handle and to analyze the inherent\ncomplexity of biological functions. As this represents one of the central issues of\nthe systems biology approach, metabolic networks have been the focus of in depth\nstudies [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">\n14</xref>], and various tools have been developed to unravel the organization of\nthese highly complex networks [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>].</p>\n",
                            "<p>The model was built from the reconstruction of these main metabolic pathways (see\nMethods). It corresponds to a so-called knowledge-based model describing the\nchemical reactions, known transcriptional, translational and post-translational\nregulations and controls of enzymatic activities. In contrast to classic\nrepresentations of genetic regulatory networks that integrate only regulation by\ntranscription factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], we have also\nincorporated transcriptional regulations by premature termination of\ntranscription. The translational and post-translational regulations correspond\nto regulation (<italic>i</italic>) by sequestration of the Ribosome Binding\nSequence (RBS); (<italic>ii</italic>) by small non-coding RNA; (<italic>iii</italic>)\nby sequestration of proteins and (<italic>iv</italic>) by proteolysis. We also\nsystematically included (<italic>i</italic>) a description of enzymatic\ncomplexes, which are represented as a sum of genes, (<italic>ii</italic>)\ngenetic organization in operons, and (<italic>iii</italic>) the number of\npromoters for each gene and the detailed conditions of transcription from each\npromoter (see Methods). The final model includes 534 genes, 563 reactions, 65\ntranscription factors (TF), 9 sigma factors and 21 other mechanisms of genetic\nregulation at the transcriptional or translational level (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). The model also includes 95 different\ngenetic regulations involving either transcription factors (and sigma factors)\nor other mechanisms. This model provides a basis for future developments of\ndynamic models.</p>\n",
                            "<p>An essential aspect of this work is the manual curation of the information. We\nintegrated the enzymatic reactions and all the regulation mechanisms which have\nbeen experimentally validated. The key literature references for each reaction\nand each regulation described are included in the model. Nevertheless, in a few\ninstances, concerning fermentation and degradation of branched-chain amino acids\n(BCAA), the existence of a functional pathway is based on indirect evidence\nrather than on a detailed study; these pathways are annotated with a comment\nindicating that the level of knowledge is low. The complete set of data (see\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>) and a\nreview of the available information on <italic>B. subtilis </italic>(see\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S2\">2</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S3\">3</xref>) are presented in\nAdditional files.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Because our model integrates information that has been confirmed by\nexperiments with the exception of fermentation and degradation of\nbranched-chain amino acids, its validation and its biological relevance are\nintrinsic. However, it is interesting to assess whether our model recovers\nknown phenotypes of <italic>B. subtilis </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>\n,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch. The absence of GMP synthesis would then prevent\nthe growth of the <italic>hprT </italic>mutant even in LB medium. Of course,\nthis prediction remains to be tested experimentally.</p>\n",

In a rich sporulation medium, <italic>asnB </italic>is expressed\nonly during exponential growth. <italic>asnH </italic>transcription increases\nduring the transition between exponential growth and stationary phase while <italic>\nasnO </italic>is expressed only later in sporulation.

                            "<p>The second category can be illustrated with the carbamoyl-phosphate-transferase.\nThis two-subunit enzyme produces carbamoyl-P from CO<sub>2</sub>, glutamine and\nATP. The carbamoyl-phosphate-transferase is involved in two pathways: arginine\nbiosynthesis and pyrimidine synthesis. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, this\nenzyme is encoded by two sets of genes: <italic>carA </italic>and <italic>carB</italic>,\nor <italic>pyrAA </italic>and <italic>pyrAB</italic>. <italic>carA </italic>and <italic>\ncarB </italic>belong to an operon with other genes involved in arginine\nsynthesis. The expression of this operon is repressed by AhrC using arginine as\ncorepressor [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>]. <italic>pyrAA </italic>\nand <italic>pyrAB </italic>belong to the pyrimidine operon, which is regulated\nby PyrR in response to the availability of metabolites of the pathway (UMP, UTP\nand PRPP) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B26\">26</xref>]. Each enzyme belongs to a\ndifferent pathway, and is synthesized under particular physiological conditions\nthereby avoiding functional redundancy. By contrast, only the <italic>carAB </italic>operon\nis present in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This operon is transcribed from two\npromoters, one controlled by arginine through the transcription factor ArgR, and\nthe second controlled by pyrimidine. In addition, the enzyme is activated by\nornithine and IMP, and inhibited by UMP [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B27\">27</xref>].\nThese two organisms have developed different regulatory solutions to achieve the\nsame goal: the production of carbamoyl-P for the syntheses of arginine and\npyrimidine.</p>\n",

Thus, they\ncould belong to the first category. Other isoenzymes are known to be regulated\nin the same way and synthesized in the same physiological conditions: (<italic>i</italic>)\nthe OAS thiol-lyases (<italic>cysK, mccA</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B30\">30</xref>], (<italic>ii</italic>) the cysteine desulfydrases (<italic>cysK,\nmccB</italic>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B31\">31</xref>], (<italic>iii</italic>)\nenzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism (the <italic>\u03b1</italic>-keto-acyl\nsynthase, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/enoyl-CoA\nhydratase complex) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B32\">32</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B9\">9</xref>].\nThese isoenzymes can catalyze different chemical reactions <italic>in vitro </italic>and\npresent different and complementary activities with respect to their substrates.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR). The remaining genetic\nregulators are ArfM, Spo0A, SpoVT, SpoIIID, GerE, CcpB and Spx.</p>\n",

YycF is indirectly involved in the regulation\nof metabolic pathways (respiration and fermentation) via a cascade of\nregulations involving PhoP, ResD, FNR and ArfM. CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

This control of a pathway as a function of the pool\nof effector metabolite was termed \"local regulation\". In turn, the set of\nenzymes associated with a local regulation and the local regulators define a\nfunctional \"elementary module\" (see details in the Discussion). For example,\nthe enzymes TrpE, TrpG, TrpD, TrpF TrpC, TrpA, TrpB involved in the\ntryptophan synthesis together with the regulators TRAP, RtpA, the\ntryptophan-specific T-box and the tryptophan-rich peptide leader Plead\ndefine an elementary module (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S26). Indeed\nthe enzymatic complex TrpE+TrpG is regulated by TRAP at the genetic level,\nand by tryptophan at the enzymatic level. This elementary module definition\nis based on the mathematical developments given in Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>, which describes the\nkey control properties associated to local regulations (according to our\ndefinition). Elementary modules have been manually identified during the\ncurated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis </italic>by a strict application of the local regulation\ndefinition. Global regulators of a metabolic pathway are defined as any\nnon-local regulators involved in the control of this pathway.

Regulation of this type is mostly found in\ndegradative pathways only induced if the first substrate is available, in\nthe central carbon pathways with CggR in glycolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>] and CcpC in the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>], and in fatty-acids biosynthesis with FapR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>].

They mainly correspond to level 2 to 5 regulators.\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref>\npresents the local/global classification of all genetic regulators of the\nreconstructed regulatory network. We have previously identified CcpA, TnrA\nand CodY as the three most important regulators involved in the control of\nmetabolic pathways, and the analysis of their local or global roles in\nregulation is summarized.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Among the other global regulators with less important roles in the general\ncontrol of metabolic pathways (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref> and previous\nparagraph), two subsets can be distinguished. The first subset is composed\nof global regulators (<italic>i</italic>) managing the metabolic function\naccording to the depletion of a critical resource, for example phosphate\navailability through the two-component system PhoPR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B48\">48</xref>], and (<italic>ii</italic>) adapting the metabolic\nnetwork to increase/decrease the production of some metabolites, for example\nthe stimulation of the conversion of cysteine from methionine by Spx when\nmethionine is the sole sulphur source [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B49\">49</xref>].\nClearly, the two global regulators chosen as examples are under the control\nof specific signals, although that sensed by Spx remains un-characterized.\nThe second subset corresponds to global regulators involved in the control\nof complex biological processes such as sporulation (SpoIIID, SpoVT, Spo0A)\nand the transition from exponential to stationary phase (AbrB and DegU).</p>\n",

Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition).

Our model includes the biochemical reactions of the\nmetabolic network and all the known levels of regulation involved in metabolic\npathways: transcriptional, translational, post-translational and modulation of\nenzymatic activities. To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch.

                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR). The remaining genetic\nregulators are ArfM, Spo0A, SpoVT, SpoIIID, GerE, CcpB and Spx.</p>\n",
                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5).

CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

CcpA directly regulates\ncarbohydrates, fatty-acids and amino acids degradation (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S6\">6</xref>, Table S3 for\ndetails).

To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch.

                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5). YycF is indirectly involved in the regulation\nof metabolic pathways (respiration and fermentation) via a cascade of\nregulations involving PhoP, ResD, FNR and ArfM. CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

This control of a pathway as a function of the pool\nof effector metabolite was termed \"local regulation\". In turn, the set of\nenzymes associated with a local regulation and the local regulators define a\nfunctional \"elementary module\" (see details in the Discussion). For example,\nthe enzymes TrpE, TrpG, TrpD, TrpF TrpC, TrpA, TrpB involved in the\ntryptophan synthesis together with the regulators TRAP, RtpA, the\ntryptophan-specific T-box and the tryptophan-rich peptide leader Plead\ndefine an elementary module (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S26). Indeed\nthe enzymatic complex TrpE+TrpG is regulated by TRAP at the genetic level,\nand by tryptophan at the enzymatic level. This elementary module definition\nis based on the mathematical developments given in Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>, which describes the\nkey control properties associated to local regulations (according to our\ndefinition). Elementary modules have been manually identified during the\ncurated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis </italic>by a strict application of the local regulation\ndefinition. Global regulators of a metabolic pathway are defined as any\nnon-local regulators involved in the control of this pathway.

They mainly correspond to level 2 to 5 regulators.\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref>\npresents the local/global classification of all genetic regulators of the\nreconstructed regulatory network.

Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

                            "<p>The model was built from the reconstruction of these main metabolic pathways (see\nMethods).

In contrast to classic\nrepresentations of genetic regulatory networks that integrate only regulation by\ntranscription factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], we have also\nincorporated transcriptional regulations by premature termination of\ntranscription. The translational and post-translational regulations correspond\nto regulation (<italic>i</italic>) by sequestration of the Ribosome Binding\nSequence (RBS); (<italic>ii</italic>) by small non-coding RNA; (<italic>iii</italic>)\nby sequestration of proteins and (<italic>iv</italic>) by proteolysis.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR).

CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

In turn, the set of\nenzymes associated with a local regulation and the local regulators define a\nfunctional \"elementary module\" (see details in the Discussion).

Indeed\nthe enzymatic complex TrpE+TrpG is regulated by TRAP at the genetic level,\nand by tryptophan at the enzymatic level.

                            "<p>We investigated the general organization of the <italic>B. subtilis </italic>metabolic\npathways and searched for possible rules of regulations. The organization\nemerges when all the levels of regulations involved in a particular metabolic\npathway are taken together. Two levels of regulation appear clearly (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>): one <bold>local </bold>and one <bold>\nglobal</bold>. The local regulation corresponds to any type of regulation\n(transcriptional, translational, termination/antitermination,\ninhibition/activation of enzymatic activity) which involves a metabolite of the\npathway controlled. This specific metabolite will be refered to as the \"key\nmetabolite\". Local regulation guarantees the activation or the inhibition of a\npathway as a function of the pool of key metabolite(s) (see proposition 2 in\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>). The\nnotion of local regulation allows identification of functional elementary\nmodules in the metabolic network.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Two classes of local regulation can be observed in the metabolic network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis</italic>. In the first class, the metabolite effector is the\nend-product of the pathway; this is the case for almost all amino-acids\nbiosyntheses. The local regulator induces enzymes synthesis of the pathway\nwhen the concentration of its effector decreases. In the second and more\nfrequent class, the metabolite effector is an intermediate metabolite of the\npathway like, for example the PRPP, which induces purine biosynthesis by\npreventing the binding of the repressor PurR to DNA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Regulation of this type is mostly found in\ndegradative pathways only induced if the first substrate is available, in\nthe central carbon pathways with CggR in glycolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>] and CcpC in the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>], and in fatty-acids biosynthesis with FapR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The local regulator of this class\ninduces enzymes synthesis when the concentration of its effector (the first\nor an intermediate metabolite) increases. In both cases, the local\nregulation causes an increase of the metabolic flux through the pathway\nupstream (for the first class) or downstream (for the second class) the\nmetabolite effector (see proposition 2 and 4 Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>). This allows a\nqualitative prediction of the modulation of the various quantities attached\nto the elementary module (abundance of mRNA, enzyme activities, and fluxes)\nin response to changes of the concentration of metabolite effectors. To\nsummarize, the local regulations lead to the emergence of functional\nelementary modules which can adapt the pathway capability according to the\nphysiological needs of the cell and to the availability of precursor\nmetabolites.</p>\n",
                            "<p>The effect of a genetic regulation is often simplified to an on/off view of\nthe pathway induction in the modelling process [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B67\">67</xref>]. In these conditions, the laws of pathway induction\ncan be described by Boolean logic conditions, which are easy to manipulate\nand to simulate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B68\">68</xref>]. Although this\ndescription is often approximate, some global regulators clearly belong to\nthis category. Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",
                            "<p>In this second category, a global regulator acts on an elementary module in a\nconcerted fashion with the local regulator. The global regulator can\nmodulate the local regulation by (<italic>i</italic>) binding directly to\nDNA, (<italic>ii</italic>) disturbing the local regulator binding. The aim\nof the global regulation is to modify the effect of the variation of the\nmetabolite effector concentration of the local regulator on the module\nsynthesis. The modulation of arginine degradation by CcpA through the\ncontrol of <italic>\u03c3</italic><sup>L </sup>production belongs to the\nsecond category, illustrating that these categories are not exclusive.\nArginine can be used as sole nitrogen source when glucose is used as the\ncarbon source [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B70\">70</xref>]. The genes\ninvolved in the arginine degradation are transcribed from a <italic>\n\u03c3</italic><sup>L</sup>-dependent promoter, and induced by RocR in\nthe presence of ornithine or citrulline [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B71\">71</xref>],\nand AhrC in the presence of arginine [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B25\">25</xref>].\nCcpA, which inhibits the transcription of <italic>sigL</italic>, indirectly\nrepresses arginine degradation [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B72\">72</xref>].\nA <italic>B. subtilis sigL </italic>mutant cannot use arginine or ornithine\nas sole nitrogen source [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B73\">73</xref>], so the <italic>\n\u03c3</italic><sup>L </sup>concentration must be low but sufficient to\nallow arginine degradation in the presence of glucose.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Global regulators sense internal metabolite pool with the exception of CodY,\nwhich senses both internal and hybrid signals. Internal global regulators are\nmainly involved in catabolism as indicated in Results and in Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref>. Since an internal\nglobal regulator controls various modules, its metabolic effector should\npresumably be correlated to a physiological state, and allow the cell to take\nglobal decisions. The concentration of the CcpA effector FBP is correlated with\nthe availability of glycolytic carbon sources [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B74\">\n74</xref>] and indirectly manages the catabolite repression through CcpA. The\nglutamine concentration, sensed by TnrA, corresponds to the availability of a\ngood ammonium source [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>]. TnrA regulates\nthe utilization of secondary nitrogen sources. Branched-chain amino acids,\nsensed by CodY, may reflect the availability of amino acids in the medium while\nGTP is strongly involved in ribosomes synthesis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B75\">\n75</xref>], sporulation and the so-called \"stringent response\" mechanism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B76\">76</xref>].

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR).

                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5).

CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

CcpA directly regulates\ncarbohydrates, fatty-acids and amino acids degradation (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S6\">6</xref>, Table S3 for\ndetails).

Our model includes the biochemical reactions of the\nmetabolic network and all the known levels of regulation involved in metabolic\npathways: transcriptional, translational, post-translational and modulation of\nenzymatic activities. To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch.

                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR). The remaining genetic\nregulators are ArfM, Spo0A, SpoVT, SpoIIID, GerE, CcpB and Spx.</p>\n",
                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5). YycF is indirectly involved in the regulation\nof metabolic pathways (respiration and fermentation) via a cascade of\nregulations involving PhoP, ResD, FNR and ArfM. CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",

Fructose-1,6-biphosphate (FBP) is\nconsidered to be the main metabolite effector of CcpA. Although CcpA binds\nto DNA as a complex with HPr-Ser46-P, FBP is required both for the\nphosphorylation of HPr by the HPr kinase and for the formation of the\nCcpA/HPr-Ser46-P complex [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B40\">40</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>]. CcpA directly regulates\ncarbohydrates, fatty-acids and amino acids degradation (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S6\">6</xref>, Table S3 for\ndetails).

Our model includes the biochemical reactions of the\nmetabolic network and all the known levels of regulation involved in metabolic\npathways: transcriptional, translational, post-translational and modulation of\nenzymatic activities. To obtain the most complete view of the interplay between the\nmetabolic network and genetic regulation, the description of each regulatory\nmechanism includes known roles of metabolite concentrations, ions, and any other\nquantities related to the state of the metabolic network.

                            "<p>The model was built from the reconstruction of these main metabolic pathways (see\nMethods). It corresponds to a so-called knowledge-based model describing the\nchemical reactions, known transcriptional, translational and post-translational\nregulations and controls of enzymatic activities. In contrast to classic\nrepresentations of genetic regulatory networks that integrate only regulation by\ntranscription factors [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], we have also\nincorporated transcriptional regulations by premature termination of\ntranscription. The translational and post-translational regulations correspond\nto regulation (<italic>i</italic>) by sequestration of the Ribosome Binding\nSequence (RBS); (<italic>ii</italic>) by small non-coding RNA; (<italic>iii</italic>)\nby sequestration of proteins and (<italic>iv</italic>) by proteolysis. We also\nsystematically included (<italic>i</italic>) a description of enzymatic\ncomplexes, which are represented as a sum of genes, (<italic>ii</italic>)\ngenetic organization in operons, and (<italic>iii</italic>) the number of\npromoters for each gene and the detailed conditions of transcription from each\npromoter (see Methods). The final model includes 534 genes, 563 reactions, 65\ntranscription factors (TF), 9 sigma factors and 21 other mechanisms of genetic\nregulation at the transcriptional or translational level (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T1\">1</xref>). The model also includes 95 different\ngenetic regulations involving either transcription factors (and sigma factors)\nor other mechanisms. This model provides a basis for future developments of\ndynamic models.</p>\n",
                            "<p>Because our model integrates information that has been confirmed by\nexperiments with the exception of fermentation and degradation of\nbranched-chain amino acids, its validation and its biological relevance are\nintrinsic. However, it is interesting to assess whether our model recovers\nknown phenotypes of <italic>B. subtilis </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>\n,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B21\">21</xref>]. In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated. Using the methodology described in Methods, we have predicted\nwhether a gene deletion is lethal or viable in two different growth\nconditions: a poor and a rich medium corresponding to a M9 glucose minimal\nmedium and a LB medium, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S4\">4</xref> for their exact\ncomposition). Compared to the results obtained in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], the introduction of genetic regulations in this\nanalysis allowed the prediction of phenotypes associated to the deletion of\ngenes encoding transcription factors (requirement of <italic>gltC</italic>, <italic>cysL,\nrtpA </italic>in minimal medium) and the recovery of so-called complex\nphenotypes resulting from the dysfunction of transcriptional regulation. One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. The <italic>hprT </italic>gene\nencodes the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which converts\nhypoxanthine and guanine in IMP and GMP, respectively (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S47), and\navoids <italic>de novo </italic>synthesis of purines. Hypoxanthine and\nguanine are indeed the effectors of the G-box riboswitch [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>] which inhibits the transcription of\ngenes involved in <italic>de novo </italic>purine synthesis. In LB medium,\nthe <italic>hprT </italic>mutant may accumulate hypoxanthine and guanine,\nwhich in turn may prevent the transcription of the <italic>pur </italic>operon\nvia the G-box riboswitch. The absence of GMP synthesis would then prevent\nthe growth of the <italic>hprT </italic>mutant even in LB medium. Of course,\nthis prediction remains to be tested experimentally.</p>\n",

                            "<p>Our model allows a detailed analysis of the interplay between metabolic pathways\nand genetic regulation through a large set of metabolic pools (and others\neffectors). Among the 79 genetic regulators whose effector is known, 70% (59)\nhave a metabolite as effector (see Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"T2\">2</xref>).\nFurthermore, eight additional regulators respond to an ion or to a component of\nthe PTS, and are thus strongly coupled to the metabolic network as they are\nlinked to the availability of particular glycolic sugars through a component of\nthe PTS. The remaining 13 genetic regulators have no effectors: 4 genetic\nregulators, AbrB, RtpA, YtlI and SR<sub>1</sub>, which are all under the control\nof other(s) genetic regulator(s) (resp. Spo0A, T-box and Plead, CymR and Spx,\nCcpN and CcpA), and nine sigma factors. The effectors for 15 genetic regulators\nare still unknown. However, indirect evidences from the literature suggest that\nat least eight of these may respond to a metabolite effector, because they are\npart of two-component systems (YycF, ResD), are involved in carbohydrate\ncatabolism (YtrA, FruR, RbsR) or regulate the synthesis of specific enzymes in\nresponse to the nutrient availability (CysL, CcpN, GlnR). The remaining genetic\nregulators are ArfM, Spo0A, SpoVT, SpoIIID, GerE, CcpB and Spx.</p>\n",
                            "<p>CcpA and YycF are the regulators of the highest level in the genetic\nregulatory network (level 5). YycF is indirectly involved in the regulation\nof metabolic pathways (respiration and fermentation) via a cascade of\nregulations involving PhoP, ResD, FNR and ArfM. CcpA, which manages carbon\nuptake and catabolism, is connected to the PhoP, ResD, Fnr and ArfM cascade.\n17% of genetic regulators are under the direct control of CcpA. Other known\npleiotropic regulators, like DegU and Spo0A, are at level 2 or 3. Their\nobserved level will presumably increase as genetic networks involved in\nother biological processes, such as sporulation or competence, are added to\nthe model. However, DegU and Spo0A clearly modulate few different enzymes\nand they do not seem to make a large contribution to the direct regulation\nof metabolic pathways. This suggests a partial decoupling between the\ncontrol of metabolic pathways and other biological processes. Metabolic\npathways are mainly under the global control of CcpA, CodY and TnrA. Other\npleiotropic transcription factors (DegU, Spo0A, AbrB) only modulate the\nexpression of very few specific enzymes which seem to be mainly involved in\nother biological processes. For example, CitB is required during sporulation\n[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B37\">37</xref>] and its synthesis is controlled\nby CodY and AbrB [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>].</p>\n",
                            "<p>All the genetic regulators of level 1 and some of level 2 regulate a specific\npathway and their potential metabolite effectors belong to the controlled\npathway (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>). This control of a pathway as a function of the pool\nof effector metabolite was termed \"local regulation\". In turn, the set of\nenzymes associated with a local regulation and the local regulators define a\nfunctional \"elementary module\" (see details in the Discussion). For example,\nthe enzymes TrpE, TrpG, TrpD, TrpF TrpC, TrpA, TrpB involved in the\ntryptophan synthesis together with the regulators TRAP, RtpA, the\ntryptophan-specific T-box and the tryptophan-rich peptide leader Plead\ndefine an elementary module (see Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S5\">5</xref>, Figure S26). Indeed\nthe enzymatic complex TrpE+TrpG is regulated by TRAP at the genetic level,\nand by tryptophan at the enzymatic level. This elementary module definition\nis based on the mathematical developments given in Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>, which describes the\nkey control properties associated to local regulations (according to our\ndefinition). Elementary modules have been manually identified during the\ncurated reconstruction of the genetic and metabolic network of <italic>B.\nsubtilis </italic>by a strict application of the local regulation\ndefinition. Global regulators of a metabolic pathway are defined as any\nnon-local regulators involved in the control of this pathway. The set of\nglobal regulators in the metabolic network is composed by all the genetic\nregulators that have been identified at least once as global regulators of a\nmetabolic pathway. They mainly correspond to level 2 to 5 regulators.\nAdditional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S8\">8</xref>\npresents the local/global classification of all genetic regulators of the\nreconstructed regulatory network. We have previously identified CcpA, TnrA\nand CodY as the three most important regulators involved in the control of\nmetabolic pathways, and the analysis of their local or global roles in\nregulation is summarized.</p>\n",
                            "<p><bold>CodY </bold>acts on various metabolic pathways, including BCAA\nsynthesis, and histidine and asparagine degradation leading to glutamate\nproduction.

The local regulator induces enzymes synthesis of the pathway\nwhen the concentration of its effector decreases. In the second and more\nfrequent class, the metabolite effector is an intermediate metabolite of the\npathway like, for example the PRPP, which induces purine biosynthesis by\npreventing the binding of the repressor PurR to DNA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Regulation of this type is mostly found in\ndegradative pathways only induced if the first substrate is available, in\nthe central carbon pathways with CggR in glycolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>] and CcpC in the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>], and in fatty-acids biosynthesis with FapR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The local regulator of this class\ninduces enzymes synthesis when the concentration of its effector (the first\nor an intermediate metabolite) increases.

This allows a\nqualitative prediction of the modulation of the various quantities attached\nto the elementary module (abundance of mRNA, enzyme activities, and fluxes)\nin response to changes of the concentration of metabolite effectors. To\nsummarize, the local regulations lead to the emergence of functional\nelementary modules which can adapt the pathway capability according to the\nphysiological needs of the cell and to the availability of precursor\nmetabolites.</p>\n",

Such global regulation behaviour is often associated with a\ndirect effect of the global regulator on local regulation (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules. However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",

Local regulations ensure that the control of\nelementary pathways through genetic and/or enzymatic regulation depends upon the\nlevel of key metabolites. The regulation of tryptophan synthesis by tryptophan\nthrough the TRAP regulatory protein is an example of such a local regulation. In\ncontrast, global regulations ensure the coordination between these elementary\npathways in response to environmental changes. For example, CcpA inhibits several\npathways during glycolytic growth conditions. The integration of these local/global\nlevels and the use of the classification of sensing signals in [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>] lead to recover the main physiological\naspects of metabolism of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.

In particular, the effects of\ngenetic regulations on prediction of the phenotypes of gene deletion can be\nevaluated.

One\nsuch example is the absence of growth of an <italic>hprT </italic>mutant on\nLB medium [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>].

In the first class, the metabolite effector is the\nend-product of the pathway; this is the case for almost all amino-acids\nbiosyntheses. The local regulator induces enzymes synthesis of the pathway\nwhen the concentration of its effector decreases. In the second and more\nfrequent class, the metabolite effector is an intermediate metabolite of the\npathway like, for example the PRPP, which induces purine biosynthesis by\npreventing the binding of the repressor PurR to DNA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>].

The local regulator of this class\ninduces enzymes synthesis when the concentration of its effector (the first\nor an intermediate metabolite) increases.

In all these cases, the role of this\nkind of global regulator is to shape or reshape the metabolic network by\nallowing the induction of new elementary modules.

Layer 4 describes the conditions of\ntranscription of the transcription factors that have been included, and also the\ncondition of activation of each transcription factor. A transcription factor is\nconsidered as \"activated\", when it is able to bind DNA. In layer 5, are\ndescribed (<italic>i</italic>) the kinetic reactions of metabolic pathways; (<italic>\nii</italic>) the genes (and operons) that encode the enzymes involved in\nreactions; (<italic>iii</italic>) the condition of transcription and translation\nof these genes; (<italic>iv</italic>) the regulation of enzymes; (<italic>v</italic>)\nthe references for these regulations.

In the first class, the metabolite effector is the\nend-product of the pathway; this is the case for almost all amino-acids\nbiosyntheses. The local regulator induces enzymes synthesis of the pathway\nwhen the concentration of its effector decreases. In the second and more\nfrequent class, the metabolite effector is an intermediate metabolite of the\npathway like, for example the PRPP, which induces purine biosynthesis by\npreventing the binding of the repressor PurR to DNA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B62\">62</xref>]. Regulation of this type is mostly found in\ndegradative pathways only induced if the first substrate is available, in\nthe central carbon pathways with CggR in glycolysis [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B63\">63</xref>] and CcpC in the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B64\">64</xref>], and in fatty-acids biosynthesis with FapR [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B65\">65</xref>]. The local regulator of this class\ninduces enzymes synthesis when the concentration of its effector (the first\nor an intermediate metabolite) increases. In both cases, the local\nregulation causes an increase of the metabolic flux through the pathway\nupstream (for the first class) or downstream (for the second class) the\nmetabolite effector (see proposition 2 and 4 Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S7\">7</xref>). This allows a\nqualitative prediction of the modulation of the various quantities attached\nto the elementary module (abundance of mRNA, enzyme activities, and fluxes)\nin response to changes of the concentration of metabolite effectors.

However, the induction of\na particular module usually remains under the control of its own local\nregulator. For example, the expression of the <italic>iol </italic>operon\n(involved in myo-inositol catabolism) is completely abolished by CcpA in the\npresence of glucose plus inositol, while in the presence of inositol alone,\nthe local regulator IolR is required for its induction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B69\">69</xref>].</p>\n",
