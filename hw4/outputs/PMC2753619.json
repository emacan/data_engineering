                            "<p>Udder health, somatic cell score and subclinical and clinical mastitis remain major challenges for the economy of milk production in respect to milk production efficiency and animal health and welfare. Several studies have attempted to identify chromosomal regions, genes and polymorphisms that influence udder health in order to improve breeding strategies. SCS has been used as an indicator of udder health and is implemented in routine sire evaluations in many countries [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. SCS has a low to medium heritability (h<sup>2 </sup>= 0.15; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]) and a strong correlation to mastitis in the German Holstein population (r<sub>g </sub>= 0.84; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]). However, selection on low SCS as well as on decreased mastitis incidence is hampered by three aspects: first the low heritability of SCS and liability to mastitis, second the difficulties in recording mastitis related data and third by potential population-wide antagonisms between milk production traits (milk, fat and protein yield) and udder health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Recently, marker assisted selection (MAS) has been determined as a promising tool to improve current selection strategies based on phenotypic data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. MAS implements genetic marker information of confirmed QTL regions to identify individuals with favourable genetic background concerning the trait of interest. Thus, the confirmation and fine mapping of known QTL regions and the estimation of QTL effects will advance the use of MAS.</p>",

In addition, K\u00fchn et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] have shown in a proof-of-principle approach that information of 5 markers located in the telomeric region of BTA18 indeed enabled successful MAS, which identified halfsib heifers prior to first calving that exhibited significant differences in SCS after parturition.</p>",
                            "<p>The intention of this study was to further analyse the middle to telomeric region of BTA18 with the aim of identifying markers and marker haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SCS in German Holstein cattle to improve MAS for udder health. Therefore, we increased the marker density in the telomeric region on BTA18 and selected four functional candidate genes within the QTL regions reported by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>]. Polymorphisms detected within these candidate genes were used as additional markers for fine mapping previously identified QTL regions and to analyse effects of candidate gene polymorphisms on SCS in the German Holstein. In the present study, we detected a genome-wide significant QTL in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18. Furthermore, we analysed effects of maternally inherited marker haplotypes and identified a two-marker-haplotype associated with SCS in German Holstein cattle.</p>",
                            "<p>Based on the positional information derived from the previously mentioned QTL regions identified by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] and preliminary results from microarray experiments, an intensive literature research of genes bearing potential function in innate immune defence, immune defence, mammary gland development or udder morphology was performed. To enable the investigation of positional candidate genes within the telomeric region on BTA18, a comparative map for BTA18 and <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>autosome 19 (HSA19) was constructed to take advantage of the more advanced gene annotation of the human genome (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>: marker table). Four candidate genes were selected: <italic>calmodulin 3 </italic>(phosphorylase kinase, delta) (<italic>CALM3</italic>), <italic>Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide </italic>(<italic>HAMP</italic>), <italic>cadherin 1, type 1, E-Cadherin </italic>(ephitelial) (<italic>CDH1</italic>), and <italic>poliovirus receptor-related 2 </italic>(herpesvirus entry mediator B) (<italic>PVRL2</italic>). Calmodulin 3 is a ubiquitously expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein that is involved in many Ca<sup>2+ </sup>modulated signal pathways. It was selected due to its influence on smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] and the potential effects on milk leaking and milk flow, which is a trait with a substantial genetic correlation to SCS (r<sub>g </sub>= 0.4; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]). <italic>HAMP </italic>was selected as an immunological candidate gene because of its antifungal and antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], the toll-like receptor-4 dependent induction by bacterial pathogens in myeloid cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>] and to a lesser extent due to its function as a key regulator of iron metabolism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. For <italic>CDH1 </italic>and <italic>PVRL2 </italic>initial results from own microarray experiments indicated their differential expression in clinically unaffected heifers with different predisposition to udder infection. Additionally, both genes are involved in cell-cell junctions that have a strong impact on tissue development. E-Cadherin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule, is involved in tissue and organ development as part of the cadherin-catenin-complex [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B19\">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>], and poliovirus receptor-related 2, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule, is involved in the organisation of intercellular junctions as part of the nectin-afadin-complex [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B20\">20</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B22\">22</xref>]. Furthermore E-Cadherin can serve as a receptor for pathogens and is involved in their internalization [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B23\">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B24\">24</xref>].</p>",

The selection strategy for the heifers and their phenotypes are described by K\u00fchn et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B13\">13</xref>] in detail. For sequencing, we selected three pairs of halfsibs, where one daughter inherited the SCS increasing paternal chromosomal region (q) and the other inherited the SCS decreasing paternal chromosomal region (Q).

In the same region telomeric on BTA18, several studies reported QTL for SCS. K\u00fchn et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B7\">7</xref>], Brink [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>] and Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] all identified a QTL for SCS in the German Holstein population at the telomeric end of BTA18 near marker <italic>TGLA227</italic>. Schulman et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] reported a QTL for SCS as well as for mastitis at the telomeric end of BTA18 in Finnish Ayrshire cattle, and Ashwell et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>] localized a QTL for SCS in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18 at marker BM2078 in US Holstein, whereas Lund et al.

Interestingly Lund et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] as well as Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] indicated that there might be more than one QTL for SCS on BTA18, but in both studies no significant evidence could be provided for a second QTL. Due to the lower marker density in previous studies and different approaches to detect QTL, a direct comparison between our results and previously mentioned studies is impeded. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals of the maxima observed in our LALD analysis did not include marker <italic>TGLA227 </italic>at the telomeric end of BTA18, and the QTL position reported by Lund et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] as well as the assumption of a second QTL by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] further in the middle of BTA18, indicated that we identified a second QTL for SCS in German Holstein cattle and possibly discovered a third QTL on BTA18 in our studies. Further indications for a third QTL on BTA18 in German Holstein cattle arise from association and haplotype analyses but no formal proof for a third QTL is given in our studies.</p>",

The variance of estimated gametic effects was higher for two-marker-interval gametes in interval 9 compared to two-marker-interval gametes in interval 12-13 and single marker analyses revealed that the microsatellite marker alleles are the main force in discriminating the effects of maternally inherited two-marker-interval gametes (Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F2\">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"F3\">3</xref>). Association analysis for maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes of interval 9 showed that none of the maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes in interval 9 (<italic>HAMP_c.366+109G&gt;A </italic>- <italic>BMS833</italic>) are in LD with SCS in the German Holstein population. However, association analysis of <italic>BMS833 </italic>genotypes showed an association with SCS in our half-sib design indicating that the association is due to linkage but not linkage disequilibrium of the BMS833 locus with the causal mutation affecting SCS.</p>",
                            "<p>For interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>), the biggest difference in gametic effects estimated for maternally inherited two-marker-interval gametes was observed between <italic>249-G </italic>(0.0378 (\u00b1 0.0018)) and <italic>253-A </italic>(- 0.0253 (\u00b1 0.0012)), where a positive mean of estimates indicates an unfavourable effect on SCS (high number of cells) and a negative mean of estimates indicates a favourable effect on SCS (low number of cells). Association analyses for the maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes of interval 12-13 showed that <italic>249-G </italic>(p = 0.027) is associated with SCS at the nominal 5% significance level in the German Holstein population. The weak association of <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>genotype with SCS within the families we investigated and the association of maternally inherited two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>with SCS indicates that <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>is not the causal mutation affecting SCS in German Holstein cattle, but the causal mutation has to be located near or within marker interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>). Combining results obtained for markers <italic>BMS833 </italic>and <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>it still remains unclear whether there are two mutations (two QTL), one located near marker <italic>BMS833 </italic>(interval 9) and one near or within interval 12-13, or only one mutation, presumably in interval 12-13, affecting SCS in the middle part of BTA18.</p>",
                            "<p>The candidate gene polymorphisms we investigated were not the causal mutations affecting SCS in German Holstein cattle. However, the results of association analyses for single marker genotypes and maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes indicated that <italic>HAMP </italic>and <italic>PVRL2 </italic>were selected within the region harbouring at least one QTL for SCS. Particularly <italic>PVRL2 </italic>still remains interesting. On the one hand, the association of the <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>genotype and that of the <italic>249-G </italic>haplotype suggests that another polymorphism within <italic>PVRL2 </italic>is the causal mutation affecting SCS in the German Holstein population. On the other hand, <italic>PVRL2 </italic>was selected as a gene with possible impact on mammary gland development or udder morphology and several studies have detected QTL for udder conformation on BTA18 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>]. Therefore, it is also possible that <italic>PVRL2 </italic>does not directly affect SCS but affects udder conformation traits like udder depth or fore udder attachment that are correlated with SCS [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In summary, our results suggest that the chromosomal region including interval 9 (<italic>HAMP_c.366+109G&gt;A </italic>- <italic>BMS833</italic>) and interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>), in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18 has a strong impact on SCS in the German Holstein population. The analyses of maternally inherited two-marker-interval gamete effects and the association of the maternally inherited two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>of interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>) with SCS indicates that micosatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>could be a suitable candidate-marker for MAS, but association of microsatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>with SCS has to be verified. To confirm the association of the two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>with SCS and approve the hypothesis of two QTL in this region a further investigation is necessary. Thus, a mapping of udder conformation traits including a multiple-trait and multiple-QTL model might be useful to verify the existence of two QTL, and whether they are both directly affecting SCS or one is affecting a correlated trait. Likewise, a higher marker density within this region has to be achieved and families segregating for different <italic>BB710 </italic>alleles have to be identified. Hence, it might be useful to cover the region including interval 9 and interval 12-13 with equally distributed SNP to narrow down the position of the casual mutation or mutations affecting SCS in the German Holstein population by a further fine mapping approach.</p>"

The putative QTL positions were considered as the midpoint of each marker interval, resulting in a total of 27 putative QTL positions.

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] all identified a QTL for SCS in the German Holstein population at the telomeric end of BTA18 near marker <italic>TGLA227</italic>. Schulman et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B10\">10</xref>] reported a QTL for SCS as well as for mastitis at the telomeric end of BTA18 in Finnish Ayrshire cattle, and Ashwell et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B50\">50</xref>] localized a QTL for SCS in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18 at marker BM2078 in US Holstein, whereas Lund et al.

Interestingly Lund et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] as well as Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] indicated that there might be more than one QTL for SCS on BTA18, but in both studies no significant evidence could be provided for a second QTL. Due to the lower marker density in previous studies and different approaches to detect QTL, a direct comparison between our results and previously mentioned studies is impeded. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals of the maxima observed in our LALD analysis did not include marker <italic>TGLA227 </italic>at the telomeric end of BTA18, and the QTL position reported by Lund et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] as well as the assumption of a second QTL by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] further in the middle of BTA18, indicated that we identified a second QTL for SCS in German Holstein cattle and possibly discovered a third QTL on BTA18 in our studies.

The weak association observed for these markers is also in accordance to our LALD analysis, because interval 13 and 14 are within the genome-wide significance threshold in LALD analysis.

First, allele frequencies and transmitting probabilities for each putative QTL position are calculated using BIGMAP [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. The putative QTL positions were considered as the midpoint of each marker interval, resulting in a total of 27 putative QTL positions. Second, the identical by descent (IBD) sub-matrices for each putative QTL position are computed based on the gene dropping procedure described by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] and third, the IBD sub-matrices are tested for positive definiteness and inverted.

Combining results obtained for markers <italic>BMS833 </italic>and <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>it still remains unclear whether there are two mutations (two QTL), one located near marker <italic>BMS833 </italic>(interval 9) and one near or within interval 12-13, or only one mutation, presumably in interval 12-13, affecting SCS in the middle part of BTA18.</p>",
                            "<p>The candidate gene polymorphisms we investigated were not the causal mutations affecting SCS in German Holstein cattle. However, the results of association analyses for single marker genotypes and maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes indicated that <italic>HAMP </italic>and <italic>PVRL2 </italic>were selected within the region harbouring at least one QTL for SCS. Particularly <italic>PVRL2 </italic>still remains interesting. On the one hand, the association of the <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>genotype and that of the <italic>249-G </italic>haplotype suggests that another polymorphism within <italic>PVRL2 </italic>is the causal mutation affecting SCS in the German Holstein population.

To confirm the association of the two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>with SCS and approve the hypothesis of two QTL in this region a further investigation is necessary. Thus, a mapping of udder conformation traits including a multiple-trait and multiple-QTL model might be useful to verify the existence of two QTL, and whether they are both directly affecting SCS or one is affecting a correlated trait. Likewise, a higher marker density within this region has to be achieved and families segregating for different <italic>BB710 </italic>alleles have to be identified. Hence, it might be useful to cover the region including interval 9 and interval 12-13 with equally distributed SNP to narrow down the position of the casual mutation or mutations affecting SCS in the German Holstein population by a further fine mapping approach.</p>",

TIGER is a UNIX script linking several individual Fortran programmes to perform combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis. Six steps are implemented in the script. First, allele frequencies and transmitting probabilities for each putative QTL position are calculated using BIGMAP [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. The putative QTL positions were considered as the midpoint of each marker interval, resulting in a total of 27 putative QTL positions. Second, the identical by descent (IBD) sub-matrices for each putative QTL position are computed based on the gene dropping procedure described by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] and third, the IBD sub-matrices are tested for positive definiteness and inverted. The software program COBRA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] computes a condensed gametic relationship matrix and its inverse at each putative QTL position for the calculation of gametic effects. Transmitting probabilities and IBD sub-matrices are used for the set up of the condensed gametic relationship matrix. Finally, an LALD analysis is performed analysing every putative QTL position with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods applied in ASReml [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>]. A detailed description of the QTL mapping procedure and the model applied in ASReml is given by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B12\">12</xref>].</p>"

Due to the lower marker density in previous studies and different approaches to detect QTL, a direct comparison between our results and previously mentioned studies is impeded. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals of the maxima observed in our LALD analysis did not include marker <italic>TGLA227 </italic>at the telomeric end of BTA18, and the QTL position reported by Lund et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B8\">8</xref>] as well as the assumption of a second QTL by Xu et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B11\">11</xref>] further in the middle of BTA18, indicated that we identified a second QTL for SCS in German Holstein cattle and possibly discovered a third QTL on BTA18 in our studies. Further indications for a third QTL on BTA18 in German Holstein cattle arise from association and haplotype analyses but no formal proof for a third QTL is given in our studies.</p>",

The weak association observed for these markers is also in accordance to our LALD analysis, because interval 13 and 14 are within the genome-wide significance threshold in LALD analysis. Additionally, the second maximum observed in our LALD analysis in interval 12 is in an immediately adjacent interval and the putative QTL position in interval 12 is approximately 1 MB upstream of <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>.

Several studies have attempted to identify chromosomal regions, genes and polymorphisms that influence udder health in order to improve breeding strategies. SCS has been used as an indicator of udder health and is implemented in routine sire evaluations in many countries [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. SCS has a low to medium heritability (h<sup>2 </sup>= 0.15; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]) and a strong correlation to mastitis in the German Holstein population (r<sub>g </sub>= 0.84; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]). However, selection on low SCS as well as on decreased mastitis incidence is hampered by three aspects: first the low heritability of SCS and liability to mastitis, second the difficulties in recording mastitis related data and third by potential population-wide antagonisms between milk production traits (milk, fat and protein yield) and udder health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Recently, marker assisted selection (MAS) has been determined as a promising tool to improve current selection strategies based on phenotypic data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. MAS implements genetic marker information of confirmed QTL regions to identify individuals with favourable genetic background concerning the trait of interest. Thus, the confirmation and fine mapping of known QTL regions and the estimation of QTL effects will advance the use of MAS.</p>",

To enable the investigation of positional candidate genes within the telomeric region on BTA18, a comparative map for BTA18 and <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>autosome 19 (HSA19) was constructed to take advantage of the more advanced gene annotation of the human genome (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"supplementary-material\" rid=\"S1\">1</xref>: marker table).

Calmodulin 3 is a ubiquitously expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein that is involved in many Ca<sup>2+ </sup>modulated signal pathways. It was selected due to its influence on smooth muscle contraction [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B14\">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B15\">15</xref>] and the potential effects on milk leaking and milk flow, which is a trait with a substantial genetic correlation to SCS (r<sub>g </sub>= 0.4; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]). <italic>HAMP </italic>was selected as an immunological candidate gene because of its antifungal and antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B16\">16</xref>], the toll-like receptor-4 dependent induction by bacterial pathogens in myeloid cells [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B17\">17</xref>] and to a lesser extent due to its function as a key regulator of iron metabolism [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B18\">18</xref>]. For <italic>CDH1 </italic>and <italic>PVRL2 </italic>initial results from own microarray experiments indicated their differential expression in clinically unaffected heifers with different predisposition to udder infection.

TIGER is a UNIX script linking several individual Fortran programmes to perform combined linkage and linkage disequilibrium analysis. Six steps are implemented in the script. First, allele frequencies and transmitting probabilities for each putative QTL position are calculated using BIGMAP [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. The putative QTL positions were considered as the midpoint of each marker interval, resulting in a total of 27 putative QTL positions. Second, the identical by descent (IBD) sub-matrices for each putative QTL position are computed based on the gene dropping procedure described by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] and third, the IBD sub-matrices are tested for positive definiteness and inverted. The software program COBRA [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B42\">42</xref>] computes a condensed gametic relationship matrix and its inverse at each putative QTL position for the calculation of gametic effects. Transmitting probabilities and IBD sub-matrices are used for the set up of the condensed gametic relationship matrix. Finally, an LALD analysis is performed analysing every putative QTL position with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods applied in ASReml [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B43\">43</xref>].

Therefore, it is also possible that <italic>PVRL2 </italic>does not directly affect SCS but affects udder conformation traits like udder depth or fore udder attachment that are correlated with SCS [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In summary, our results suggest that the chromosomal region including interval 9 (<italic>HAMP_c.366+109G&gt;A </italic>- <italic>BMS833</italic>) and interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>), in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18 has a strong impact on SCS in the German Holstein population. The analyses of maternally inherited two-marker-interval gamete effects and the association of the maternally inherited two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>of interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>) with SCS indicates that micosatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>could be a suitable candidate-marker for MAS, but association of microsatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>with SCS has to be verified. To confirm the association of the two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>with SCS and approve the hypothesis of two QTL in this region a further investigation is necessary. Thus, a mapping of udder conformation traits including a multiple-trait and multiple-QTL model might be useful to verify the existence of two QTL, and whether they are both directly affecting SCS or one is affecting a correlated trait. Likewise, a higher marker density within this region has to be achieved and families segregating for different <italic>BB710 </italic>alleles have to be identified. Hence, it might be useful to cover the region including interval 9 and interval 12-13 with equally distributed SNP to narrow down the position of the casual mutation or mutations affecting SCS in the German Holstein population by a further fine mapping approach.</p>",

Several studies have attempted to identify chromosomal regions, genes and polymorphisms that influence udder health in order to improve breeding strategies. SCS has been used as an indicator of udder health and is implemented in routine sire evaluations in many countries [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]. SCS has a low to medium heritability (h<sup>2 </sup>= 0.15; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>]) and a strong correlation to mastitis in the German Holstein population (r<sub>g </sub>= 0.84; [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]). However, selection on low SCS as well as on decreased mastitis incidence is hampered by three aspects: first the low heritability of SCS and liability to mastitis, second the difficulties in recording mastitis related data and third by potential population-wide antagonisms between milk production traits (milk, fat and protein yield) and udder health [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B2\">2</xref>]. Recently, marker assisted selection (MAS) has been determined as a promising tool to improve current selection strategies based on phenotypic data [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B3\">3</xref>]. MAS implements genetic marker information of confirmed QTL regions to identify individuals with favourable genetic background concerning the trait of interest.

Due to the lower marker density in previous studies and different approaches to detect QTL, a direct comparison between our results and previously mentioned studies is impeded. Nevertheless, the confidence intervals of the maxima observed in our LALD analysis did not include marker <italic>TGLA227 </italic>at the telomeric end of BTA18, and the QTL position reported by Lund et al.

First, allele frequencies and transmitting probabilities for each putative QTL position are calculated using BIGMAP [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B38\">38</xref>]. The putative QTL positions were considered as the midpoint of each marker interval, resulting in a total of 27 putative QTL positions. Second, the identical by descent (IBD) sub-matrices for each putative QTL position are computed based on the gene dropping procedure described by [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B39\">39</xref>-<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B41\">41</xref>] and third, the IBD sub-matrices are tested for positive definiteness and inverted.

Combining results obtained for markers <italic>BMS833 </italic>and <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>it still remains unclear whether there are two mutations (two QTL), one located near marker <italic>BMS833 </italic>(interval 9) and one near or within interval 12-13, or only one mutation, presumably in interval 12-13, affecting SCS in the middle part of BTA18.</p>",
                            "<p>The candidate gene polymorphisms we investigated were not the causal mutations affecting SCS in German Holstein cattle. However, the results of association analyses for single marker genotypes and maternally inherited two-marker-haplotypes indicated that <italic>HAMP </italic>and <italic>PVRL2 </italic>were selected within the region harbouring at least one QTL for SCS. Particularly <italic>PVRL2 </italic>still remains interesting. On the one hand, the association of the <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A </italic>genotype and that of the <italic>249-G </italic>haplotype suggests that another polymorphism within <italic>PVRL2 </italic>is the causal mutation affecting SCS in the German Holstein population. On the other hand, <italic>PVRL2 </italic>was selected as a gene with possible impact on mammary gland development or udder morphology and several studies have detected QTL for udder conformation on BTA18 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B51\">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B52\">52</xref>]. Therefore, it is also possible that <italic>PVRL2 </italic>does not directly affect SCS but affects udder conformation traits like udder depth or fore udder attachment that are correlated with SCS [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B1\">1</xref>].</p>",
                            "<p>In summary, our results suggest that the chromosomal region including interval 9 (<italic>HAMP_c.366+109G&gt;A </italic>- <italic>BMS833</italic>) and interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>), in the middle to telomeric region on BTA18 has a strong impact on SCS in the German Holstein population. The analyses of maternally inherited two-marker-interval gamete effects and the association of the maternally inherited two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>of interval 12-13 (<italic>BB710 </italic>- <italic>PVRL2_c.392G&gt;A</italic>) with SCS indicates that micosatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>could be a suitable candidate-marker for MAS, but association of microsatellite marker <italic>BB710 </italic>with SCS has to be verified. To confirm the association of the two-marker-haplotype <italic>249-G </italic>with SCS and approve the hypothesis of two QTL in this region a further investigation is necessary. Thus, a mapping of udder conformation traits including a multiple-trait and multiple-QTL model might be useful to verify the existence of two QTL, and whether they are both directly affecting SCS or one is affecting a correlated trait. Likewise, a higher marker density within this region has to be achieved and families segregating for different <italic>BB710 </italic>alleles have to be identified. Hence, it might be useful to cover the region including interval 9 and interval 12-13 with equally distributed SNP to narrow down the position of the casual mutation or mutations affecting SCS in the German Holstein population by a further fine mapping approach.</p>",

Markers of intervals with marker spacing set to small values greater than zero are indicated by *. For some markers no accession number was available, therefore references for sequence information are given [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B5\">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B53\">53</xref>]. The polymorphism information content was calculated using the software PowerMarker v3.25 [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B54\">54</xref>]. Marker positions are in order to positions of 5'-nucleotides of upstream primers for microsatellite markers or the direct position of the SNP. In Build3.1 several discrepancies in the sequence assembly were discovered. Discrepancies to the refined marker order are highlighted in yellow. Comparative positions in HSA36.3 were assigned by BLAST search of marker sequences in the bovine whole genome assembly Btau4.0 to identify the nearest gene locus on BTA18 and locating this gene locus in HSA36.3 using NCBI Map Viewer [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"B34\">34</xref>].</p>",
