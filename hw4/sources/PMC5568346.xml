Despite its multiple understandings, at the present work, ECS was defined as a lifesaving surgical procedure. Worldwide, an estimated 45% of deaths and 36% of disability-adjusted life years could be prevented through expanded access to ECS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite the vital role of ECS in reducing global morbidity and mortality, access barriers persist particularly among disadvantaged populations due to socioeconomic and demographic factors. These access barriers are frequently intensified in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Traditionally, literature on access to ECS focuses on social determinants of health, and demand-side barriers to health care access, such as the unaffordable costs of medical care or inadequate patient education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, in the case of ECS, the role of supply-side factors, particularly the geographical distribution of health facilities, is not well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Many studies concentrate on travel distance to primary care facilities and its effects on health care access, patient outcomes, and the utilization of ECS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Likewise, there are numerous studies on the distribution of ECS in relation to patient mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However in the current literature, there has yet to be a study evaluating how effectively appropriately equipped small hospitals (SH) can fill this ECS care gaps and contribute to improve access to emergency care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite challenges concerning economies of scale and quality, there is an argument that SH are needed in remote regions, particularly for general health needs beyond primary care, urgent care services, and maternal-infant care in low-risk situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The interest in the health service infrastructure&#x02019;s spatial distribution has gained momentum in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Spatial analysis and geographic information systems have proven to be of great utility to study the allocation and planning of services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Several literature reviews describe the evolution of research in the field of health geography and its different applications in diverse countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These studies showed spatial analysis has been widely useful to investigate the relationship between access, geography, utilization, quality, and health indicators. Further, the literature utilizes quantitative and qualitative methods to measure potential access to health facilities, in order to assess disparities in health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For this reason, studies of this nature are essential for health managers to analyze and define strategies for the provision of health services and policy formulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Considering this context the main objective of the present work was identify geographic access barriers to ECS in Brazil. The secondary goal was to define possible roles to be assumed by SH as a potential alternative to overcome access barriers. Was hypothesized that Brazilian SH could help to minimize lack of access to emergency services.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par19">The present work can be classified as a cross-sectional ecological study. Were analyzed data about 5843 Brazilian hospitals in three phases: 1) evaluation of the distances among SH and nearest high complexity center (HCC) within administrative regions; 2) assessment of geographical accessibility to hospital care; 3) identification of clusters of municipalities with minimal-structured SH for surgical care located in regions with low HCC accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par20">Brazil is an upper-middle income country with 206 million inhabitants (IBGE, 2016). The Brazilian health system is organized to provide universal access to entire population - the Sistema &#x000da;nico de Sa&#x000fa;de - SUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The country is divided into five administrative regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast and South), 26 states, and the federal district (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Up to 2013, the Brazilian healthcare network was composed of 5843 hospitals, 2774 of which were SH and 3069 HCC. Considering the guidelines from Brazilian Ministry of Health, a facility is classified as SH if the number of beds available is equal or less to 50. HCC are defined as institutions with: presence of certification related to ECS and capacity to offer surgical procedures related to ECS, or realized more than 1000 deliveries by month. The HCC were stratified in 2559 exclusive high complexity centers and 486 facilities that were also acting as maternities. From the universe of HCC was made the option to exclude of analysis 24 facilities for been exclusively maternities. These maternities do not act like a complete ECS facility once they do not meet all the criteria defined by Brazilian Ministry of Health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In Brazil, we have guidelines trying to organize the referrals of patients, but no rule or law defining which type of health facility a municipality should have. Thus, there are municipalities in our study in all possible conditions: with SH and HCC, only SH, only HCC, none hospital.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Brazilian states, regions and hospital network</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12939_2017_645_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data sources and variables</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Hospital data</title><p id="Par21">SH data was collected through a national survey about infrastructure and quality of care described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. SH data used were: number of beds, physical structure available to offer emergency care and geographical coordinates. HCC data was collected using secondary databases to gather information about: geographical coordinates, certifications, number of beds and administrative information through the records of the National Registry of Health Facilities (NRHF or CNES in Portuguese) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. All data referring SH and HCC were collected during 2014.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Demographic data</title><p id="Par22">Population data of all 5565 Brazilian municipalities was collected from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics selecting the estimates referring to 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data analysis</title><p id="Par23">Data analysis was divided in three steps and was conducted using Python [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and ARCMAP 10.2 softwares [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The first step is independent, while the second and third steps were related.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>First step - distance patterns</title><p id="Par24">It was evaluated the Euclidean distance of SH to the nearest HCC within the same state, simulating the healthcare network flow. In this way, the search for a referral HCC was confined to each state, excluding searches for HCC in other states even, if they were located in geographical lower distance. Distance was divided into four distinct groups, based on the regulation of the Brazilian Ministry of Health of travel time to reach health care: (a) less than 60&#x000a0;km from the municipality of the HCC (approximately 1&#x000a0;h of travel time); (b) between 60 and 90&#x000a0;km from the HCC (approximately 1.5&#x000a0;h of travel time); between 90 and 120&#x000a0;km from the HCC (approximately 2&#x000a0;h of travel time) and lastly; (d) more than 120&#x000a0;km from the HCC (approximately more than 2&#x000a0;h of travel time). This analysis highlights the existing gaps in the health care network (HCN) in relation to ECS coverage and access.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Second step - accessibility to ECS care</title><p id="Par25">To evaluate geographical accessibility to ECS care was used the two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. With this approach it was possible assess the accessibility by the interaction of two geographic characteristics: (a) volume of available hospital beds in each hospital to a determined population within 1&#x000a0;h of travel distance, and (b) the proximity of services to that population, within a 60&#x000a0;km buffer from each municipality centroid. The 2SFCA method generated an accessibility index for each municipality in Brazil. Two 2SFCA were performed, one for SH and other for HCC. The accessibility index of each municipality was classified in two categories: below of above the average access to ECS.</p><p id="Par26">In sequence, to evaluate the discrepancies in ECS care accessibility it was performed a spatial overlap among the different ECS care scenarios considering accessibility to SH and to HCC. The spatial overlap selection highlighted geographical areas where there were simultaneous categorizations as above average access to SH and below average access to HCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Third step - spatial association</title><p id="Par27">Despite the fact that municipalities selected by the spatial overlap method indicate geographic regions where SH could offer an alternative to overcome access barriers, this is not enough to ensure satisfactory emergency care. SH usually face problems related to poor quality of care due to lack of minimum emergency requirements capable of guaranteeing adequate health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Taking this limitation into account was used a minimum emergency service requirements (MESR) adherence proportion for each SH. This index was elaborated in a previous work realized by BARBOSA et all, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. MERS index is defined by the presence of the following structure of care: emergency monitoring equipment, electrocardiogram, mechanical respirator, defibrillator, sphygmomanometer, laboratory services and diagnosis support, physicians available 24&#x000a0;h, anesthesiology services, and operations during 24&#x000a0;h a day. This adherence proportion was used as an assessment of SH capabilities to offer more complex emergency care.</p><p id="Par28">To each municipality covered by a SH but not a HCC was assigned an average of MESR index. This assignment was only realized for cities selected through spatial overlap procedure. Then was used the Getis Ord Gi spatial autocorrelation test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] to recognize spatial clusters of municipalities considering the different levels of MESR values. Getis Ord Gi statistics evaluate the spatial dependency effect of the frequency and attribute values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As a result Getis Ord Gi technique highlighted spatial clusters related to different values of MERS. Hot spots indicate clusters of high values, while cold spots the opposite. Thus, it was possible to check the presence of municipalities distant from HCC even though covered by SH with minimum conditions to offer more complex emergency care.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Results</title><p id="Par29">The majority of SH in Brazil was located at Northeast region (40,34%). The Southeast region has the higher proportion of HCC (40,57%). The North region had the lowest percentage of hospitals in both categories (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Despite the difference related to number of SH the mean of beds available did not present big changes among Brazilian regions. The Brazilian average of beds by population is quite similar among SH and HCC. For the Northeast region, there were more beds per population from SH than from HCC, highlighting the local relevance of such type of hospital to access of health services.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characterization of Brazilian health care network</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"/><th colspan="3">Small hospitals</th><th colspan="3">High Complexity Centers</th></tr><tr><th>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">The present work tried to contribute to diminishing the lack of literature approaching the need for the reduction of geographical access barriers to ECS services. Among the objectives of this effort was the analysis of possible roles to be assumed by Brazilian SH to improve ECS access. In Brazil, one study mapped the network of the provision of health services based on the origin and destination of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The results revealed an extensive network of primary care provision, in which only a few municipalities are disconnected. Yet, approximately half of Brazilian municipalities are disconnected from a network of high complexity services. Most SH are found in low and medium sized municipalities. Facilities classified as SH are recognized to face operational and quality problems, despite their prevalence in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In most cases SH fulfill a role similar to primary care, without the capacity to perform surgeries and admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, populations solely reliant on SH frequently need to travel to municipalities with HCC resulting in geographic access barriers.</p><p id="Par35">The analysis of emergency care capabilities among municipalities with SH and those covered by HCC enables the identification of access barriers to high complexity services in Brazil. Furthermore it makes possible an exam of possible roles that SH could assume in the HCN. SH fall short in attaining optimal economies of scale in relation to their function. Therefore, the justification of their existence in HCN service provision is to guarantee access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The results revealed concentrations of municipalities with SH and HCC located in the South, Southeast, and Northeast coastal regions of Brazil. These regions also showed many SH close to reference HCC, which could indicate an overlap among healthcare roles. If some of these small hospitals offer satisfactory emergency care, their role in the HCN is not optimal, and their integration into the health system needs to be rethought. In a large part of north region, there is a gap of ECS services once the emergency units are concentrated in large cities. In these circumstances, the possibility of reconfiguring the role of SH arises as a way of improving access.</p><p id="Par36">SH often experience challenges with lack of structure, human resources, and work processes, and generally do not have a specific role in regional HCN, resulting in idle capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One can note the lower coverage of SH in the Central-West, rural Northeast, and, markedly, the North region. States such as Amazonas, Amap&#x000e1;, Par&#x000e1; and Roraima contain large segments of territory without emergency specialized services. The conjoint evidences from 2SFCA and spatial cluster analysis pointed out municipalities covered by SH located in these regions presented low values of MESR adherence proportion. In these circumstances, changing the role of SH is not sufficient. It is essential to invest in the implementation of an integrated HCN that takes into account offering the necessary health services to the population covered. Furthermore analysis about desirable features of each SH should be defined by installed healthcare structure, the composition of the workforce, financial profile and role to be assumed inside a HCN. A combined evaluation of these factors could catalyze reforms to offer better structured ECS.</p><p id="Par37">The situation highlighted by hotspot analysis yields new possibilities to reduce geographical access barriers. Hot spot clusters could be considered as alternatives to increase access to high complexity services. Investments to better outfit SH in these regions could improve access to ECS, as the travel time to a emergency service could be shortened. In these regions SH could get a role dedicated to offer more complex care, contributing to better structuring of HCN. This reorientation can contribute to foster equity in access and strengthen Brazilian emergency services system.</p><p id="Par38">The results demonstrate the distribution of health services in Brazil, based on selected indicators is currently inadequate to meet population needs. Both, the concentration and the role of health facilities in HCN need to be rethought in order to overcome current inequalities in accessing ECS. HCN need to be reorganized in a way that optimizes flows and facilitates efficient processes in economies of scale, without curtailing the population&#x02019;s access to services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The present research revealed that SH could be a possible solution to improve access to ECS, since they receive investments. Fulfilling needs like: better equipment, adequate human resources and defined roles in HCN can create conditions for health facilities provide ECS for a portion of population that is facing access barriers.</p><p id="Par39">While overcoming some limitations of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], it is worth emphasizing that distances to health facilities located among states borders were not analyzed which is a limitation of the results found. All analyzed distances were confined to the same state, justifiable by the fact that decentralization in health care has led to the development of policy plans that have an intrastate scope in Brazil. Notwithstanding, there is evidence of agreements among states, primarily in the case of border municipalities, which may influence transportation time to access health services.</p><p id="Par40">For future studies, it would be interesting to exam the services quality offered in emergency facilities as well as adopt dynamically capabilities for each hospital considered in 2SFCA. Added to this contribution should be interesting the evaluation of different indicators, together with parameters from other levels of care, given that reforming of small hospitals roles may be influenced by the quality of care delivered at other levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">This study sought to analyze how the spatial distribution of hospitals in Brazil could influence access to ECS, with a focus on the examination of the geographical access barriers. The results demonstrate spatial disequilibrium within the country, with significant gaps in HCN for emergency care and a large concentration of SH in wealthier regions, suggesting imbalances and inequity in service provision. Due to the implications carried out by the spatial distribution of health services and the growing relevance of health geography in health systems design, the current discussion points for the need to reorganize the distribution and roles of hospital network in Brazil. There were several municipalities located greater than 60&#x000a0;km from emergency centers highlighting gaps in emergency coverage that could prove useful to inform policy makers. Although such reorganization may face challenges from an economic and political perspective, the present findings underscore how a combined analysis among different services is necessary to consolidate accessibility and quality in health system.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>2SFCA</term><def><p id="Par5">Two-step floating catchment area</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECS</term><def><p id="Par6">Emergency care services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDP</term><def><p id="Par7">Gross domestic product</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p id="Par8">High complexity center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCN</term><def><p id="Par9">Health care network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LMIC</term><def><p id="Par10">Low and middle-income countries</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MERS</term><def><p id="Par11">Minimum emergency service requirements</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NRHF</term><def><p id="Par12">National Registry of Health Facilities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par13">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SH</term><def><p id="Par14">Small hospitals</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par42">Funding from the Brazilian Ministry of Health exclusively covered costs of data collection from small hospitals.
