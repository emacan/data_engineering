Suppression of appetite and food intake has consistently been shown to be diminished with high fat relative to either high protein or carbohydrate meals. There is however some evidence that the satiating capacity of lipids may be modulated when physicochemical properties are altered, but studies investigating the effect of lipid saturation on appetite have generated inconsistent findings. This study investigated the effects of changes in fatty acid saturation on post-ingestive satiety and energy intake.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>High-fat (HF) test breakfasts (2.0 MJ) containing 26 g lipid were given to 18 healthy, lean men in a 3 treatment randomised cross-over design, each treatment separated by a washout of at least 3 days. The breakfasts were high in saturated (SFA, 65% of total fat), polyunsaturated (PUFA, 76%) or monounsaturated (MUFA, 76%) fatty acids, and comprised 2 savoury muffins. Participants rated appetite sensations using visual analogue scales (VAS) to assess palatability immediately following the meals, and hunger and fullness prior to the HF breakfast and throughout the day. Energy intake was measured by covert weighing of a lunch meal which was served 3.5 h after the breakfast, and from which the participants ate <italic>ad libitum</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was no difference in VAS ratings of pleasantness, visual appearance, smell, taste, aftertaste and overall palatability between the 3 high-fat test breakfasts. However, there was also no differential effect of the 3 treatments on ratings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction or prospective food consumption during the 3.5 h following the breakfast meal and over the full 6 h experiment. Energy and macronutrient intake at lunch also did not differ between treatments (mean, sem; SFA: 5275.9 &#x000b1; 286.5 kJ; PUFA: 5227.7 &#x000b1; 403.9 kJ; MUFA: 5215.6 &#x000b1; 329.5 kJ; P &#x0003e; 0.05). The maximum difference in energy intake between treatments was less than 2%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>There was no evidence of a difference in post-ingestion satiety between high fat meals which differed in saturation profile in this group of lean, healthy men.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTRN12610000193077</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>A high intake of dietary fat has long been implicated in the development of obesity with a positive association between a high-fat (HF), high-energy dense diet and a high body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Whether there is a causal relationship between dietary fat and the current high levels of obesity continues to be debated however, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] as does dietary fat as a primary driver of hyperphagia, or overconsumption, during weight gain. In a number of early studies dietary fat was shown to exert a weaker satiating effect than isoenergetic amounts of either carbohydrate (CHO) or protein in most [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], although not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] studies.

The inability of lipids to mount a strong postprandial satiety-related hormone response relative to the other macronutrients may also contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>There is also some evidence to suggest that the association of a HF diet with weight gain and obesity may in part depend on the saturation of the fatty acids (FA) consumed and that unsaturated, and in particular polyunsaturated FAs (PUFA), may be associated with lower adiposity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Several studies have shown that the rate of postprandial fat oxidation, purported to act as a satiety feedback signal, is negatively related to the degree of saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In early studies degree of saturation was also linked with changes in putative appetite modifiers such as CCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], insulin and serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, effects on <italic>ad libitum </italic>energy intake (EI) have been reported. Whilst there is some evidence of PUFA having the strongest and MUFA the weakest suppression of food intake, clinical studies are inconsistent and variable. A gastrointestinal infusion study showed high-PUFA Intralipid<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(a fat emulsion comprising largely soybean oil) and linoleic acid (18:2) to decrease intake when compared with a no-fat saline control, whilst carbon chain length (CCL) -matched stearic acid (C18:0, SFA) and oleic acid (C18:1, MUFA) did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In a feeding study of CCL-matched fats, both high-PUFA and high-SFA meals decreased food intake when compared with high-MUFA meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and a second infusion study showed lauric acid (C12:0 SFA) but not the longer chain oleic acid (C18:1 MUFA) to decrease food intake relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Conversely, other studies have found less convincing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] or no evidence of saturation affecting <italic>ad libitum </italic>EI or appetite ratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], or with response differing by gender [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>This lack of consensus led to our current study which investigated whether changes in the saturation profile of a high-fat breakfast meal affected postprandial appetite sensations and food consumption at the subsequent meal using a study design which we have previously shown to be sensitive to manipulations in energy and fat content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Based on prior studies we hypothesized that there may be a satiety hierarchy of PUFA &#x0003e; SFA &#x0003e; MUFA when a high fat meal balanced for both energy and total fat content is consumed.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Lean male participants (BMI 18-25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), aged between 18-55 years were recruited into this intervention trial through poster, newspaper and electronic advertisement. Body weight and height were measured whilst fasted on 2 consecutive occasions and mean BMI recorded. Participants were from the local community including tertiary institutions. Exclusion criteria were self-reported current or previous history of overweight or obesity, current or recent history (previous 6 months) of dieting including commercial weight loss programs or weight loss surgery, eating disorders or significant restraint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], smoking, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (type I or II), and any significant metabolic, endocrine or gastrointestinal disease. Normal lipid profile, full blood count and fasting blood glucose levels were also ensured at screen. None of the participants were taking medications known to affect appetite or weight regulation. Written consent was obtained from each of the participants. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Northern Regional Ethics Committee, Auckland, New Zealand.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>This was a randomised, 3 treatment cross-over trial where the effects of a HF test breakfast supplemented with SFA, PUFA or MUFA were assessed through subjective visual analogue scales (VAS) and <italic>ad libitum </italic>EI at a single lunch meal. The primary objective of measurement of food intake at the lunch meal was not revealed to the participants prior to the study. All participants attended the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU) on three separate occasions between which they returned home for a washout period of at least 3 days where they were asked to resume their habitual diet and exercise pattern. Participants were asked to abstain from alcohol and strenuous physical activity for 24 hours prior to the study-day, and to complete a 24-hour dietary recall and physical activity questionnaires. Physical activity was estimated using a questionnaire evaluating activities according to duration and intensity using the PEPSA (Physical Exercise Programme for Sedentary Adults) points system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] to assess whether differences in activity on the day prior to the test may have confounded measured outcomes of appetite.</p><p>Participants were asked to fast from 2000 h the previous evening, including liquids, not to exercise in the morning and to arrive at the Unit using motorized transport. At the clinic body weight and waist circumference were measured fasted, and adverse events and/or medications used between treatments recorded. Immediately upon arrival at 7 am the participants were given 200 ml water which they were required to drink in full, after which they were asked to complete baseline VAS rating their subjective feelings of hunger, fullness, satisfaction and prospective food consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. A venous cannula was also inserted for sequential collection of blood samples throughout the morning, and lipid profile, glucose and insulin concentrations were measured. The HF test breakfast was served at 0830 h and participants were asked to consume the test-meal in full but at their own pace within a 15 minute period. The exact duration of the meal was recorded. No further foods were allowed throughout the morning until an <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch meal was served 210 minutes later, at 1200 h, to assess energy and macronutrient intake. Lunch was served individually in a quiet dining room with minimal distractions. VAS ratings were measured throughout the morning and for 2 hours after completion of the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch. All measurements of food intake were covert. Participants remained at the HNU during each study-day and were allowed to read, write or undertake other such sedentary activities but were not allowed to sleep.</p></sec><sec><title>High-fat test breakfasts</title><p>The 3 breakfast treatments were HF (50 en% fat) and isoenergetic (2.0 MJ), comprising 2 savoury muffins (ingredients: flour, skimmed milk powder, eggs, tomato, ham, test lipid). The lipids were included as an integral part of the recipe and baked into the muffins. The test breakfast was served at 0830 h, co-presented with 300 ml water. The treatments differed in FA composition and were (i) high-SFA (from butter fat), (ii) high-PUFA (from safflower oil) or (iii) high-MUFA (from olive oil).

This is consistent with a number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] previously published studies, and there are several issues concerning study design which it is important to consider.</p><p>There are a wide range of published methods by which short-term appetite regulation has been assessed but consensus is yet to be achieved as to best practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The methodology in our current trial was based primarily on the lipid emulsion trials of Burns and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] where small manipulations in lipids at a test breakfast induced significant changes in EI at a subsequent lunch meal. Arguably, the long separation between the intervention and the <italic>ad lib </italic>lunch (&#x0003e;3 hours) in these trials may make changes in eating behaviour more difficult to effect than studies where an outcome meal is given only 60 or 90 minutes following the test treatment. In our current trial however the <italic>ad lib </italic>energy intake was consistent with the recorded postprandial feelings of hunger and fullness which also did not differ across lipid treatments. It is possible that the varied item buffet-style lunch may have encouraged overconsumption, decreased sensitivity and masked differential effects, but again it is notable that a multi-item buffet lunch has previously been shown to be sensitive to effects of acute lipid manipulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. We have previously shown it to be sensitive to changes in energy content at a breakfast meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Pleasantness, visual appeal, smell, taste, after-taste and palatability were all well matched between treatments in our current trial, and differences in the energy density of the test lipids were small.</p><p>There is little consensus as to whether degree of lipid saturation may play a role in regulation of body weight and adiposity through mechanisms driving changes in either intake or oxidation. Whilst epidemiological evidence of an association between lipid saturation and adiposity in studies such as the Quebec Family Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] suggest that saturation may influence either intake or oxidation, evidence remains scant. Friedman originally proposed the hypothesis that oxidation of macronutrients following a meal may exert a negative feedback on appetite and eating behavior, and hence control the satiating power of a given nutrient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whilst human studies have been unable confirm this mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], there are some data which do show an oxidative gradient may exist and may be driven in part by FA saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and hence the hypothesis remains of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, FA saturation has also been shown to impact postprandial hormone response including the peptides insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] and CCK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] which may drive changes in intake, although again the data remains inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>Much of the evidence for effect of saturation on EI has been derived from acute studies of intake of similar design to our current trial and also from acute GI infusion trials, several of which show increased satiety effects of PUFA. Intestinal infusion of Intralipid (54% PUFA linoleic acid, 29% MUFA oleic acid) and PUFA (linoleic acid), but not SFA (stearic acid) or MUFA (oleic acid) emulsions tended to decrease EI relative to a saline control in a study of men given a restricted lunch meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The effects were modest however with no significant differential effects between the 4 fat loaded treatments. This was supported in part by Lawton <italic>et al </italic>(2000) in a CCL-matched feeding study which demonstrated decreased ratings of appetite and a trend, albeit non-significant, towards lower <italic>ad lib </italic>EI over the rest of the day following a high-PUFA (linoleic acid) and SFA (stearic-oleic blend) lunch meal compared with a lunch rich in MUFA (oleic acid) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A second study by the same authors was unable to confirm these results, although merging data from the 2 studies did support the greater satiety effects of PUFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. A more recent intraduodenal infusion study of the C12:0 SFA lauric acid versus longer chain C18:1 MUFA oleic acid showed a decrease in EI following the SFA but not MUFA treatment relative to a saline control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Conversely, there are also studies which find MUFA to be more satiating than PUFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For example, Burton-Freeman <italic>et al </italic>(2005) found that mean VAS scores of appetite satisfaction were greater following a high-oleic safflower oil (high-MUFA) compared with a walnut oil (high-PUFA) preload, although it is notable that this result was not substantiated by 4 other appetite-related VAS or subsequent <italic>ad lib </italic>EI at lunch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Finally there are further trials which are consistent with our current study and which have been unable to detect a difference in ratings of appetite or EI between meals of varying saturation profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is apparent that a clear effect of lipid saturation on satiety has yet to be established.</p><p>Some variability in outcome may in part be due to differences in methods. Important aspects of trials assessing postprandial changes in appetite may include number and characteristics of participants; lipid dose, composition and route of administration; inter-meal interval; and composition and variety of foods offered at the <italic>ad lib </italic>outcome meal. These have been summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. Of the trials so far conducted, all were small sample studies (8-25 participants) conducted predominantly in lean, healthy participants. Dose of lipid administered does not appear to unduly bias outcome since studies by Lawton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and Flint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] both administered high doses of lipid (&#x0003e;50 g fat), yet only the Lawton study conducted in lean participants showed differential effects of FA saturation. The fact that delivery of lower doses, such as our current trial (26 g), are sufficient to elicit a response was demonstrated by Kamphuis and colleagues where a 25 g lipid supplement differentially altered EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Burton-Freeman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] administered a low dose (9-13 g) lipid treatment yet observed significant effects on some VAS-assessed satiety ratings, albeit these did not result in suppression of EI at a subsequent test meal. The route of lipid administration is likely to also be important and it is notable that 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] of the 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] trials where a differential response was elicited delivered the lipid treatments via GI infusion hence bypassing early sensory and cognitive signaling. Whilst it is difficult to find methodological issues directly responsible for the variable outcome of the studies to date, each of the trials appears robust in its approach, it is clear that a strong case cannot be built for enhanced satiety with high-SFA, MUFA or PUFA based on current evidence.</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Previous studies investigating the effect of fatty acid saturation on subjective appetite ratings and <italic>ad libitum </italic>energy intake (measured or from diet records) at a meal, highlighting methodological differences between trials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Publication</th><th align="left">Participants</th><th align="left">Lipid dose</th><th align="left">Lipid composition [% of total lipid]</th><th align="left">Inter-meal interval</th><th align="left">Study endpoint</th><th align="left">Study outcome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Current study: Strik <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</td><td align="left">Lean, men, n = 18</td><td align="left">26 g, [50 en% fat]</td><td align="left">Butter fat, high stearic-lauric blend [65% SFA];

Lipid dose, the interval between test-breakfast and <italic>ad libitum </italic>outcome lunch, and the composition of the <italic>ad lib </italic>meal have all been identified as areas which may bias outcome. In this study we administered a 26 g lipid test meal which was well matched for sensory outcomes between treatments, 3.5 hours prior to a free choice lunch meal. Whether a higher dose lipid product administered as a preload rather than test meal, i.e. closer to the lunch meal, would elicit an appetite response is unknown. Certainly there is little consensus on effects of dietary lipid composition on appetite control from previous studies. Whether appetite may be altered by longer term and sustained changes in dietary fatty acid composition also remains to be demonstrated.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>ANOVA: analysis of variance; BMI: body mass index; CCL: carbon chain length; CCK: cholecystokinin; CHO: carbohydrate; EI: energy intake; FA: fatty acid; HF: high fat; HNU: human nutrition unit; MANOVA: multivariate analysis of variance; MUFA: monounsaturated fatty acid; PEPSA: Physical Exercise Programme for Sedentary Adults; PUFA: polyunsaturated fatty acid; SD: standard deviation; SEM: standard error of the mean; SFA: saturated fatty acid; VAS: visual analogue score.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of Competing interests</title><p>SDP, ATM, FEL, CMS, AKM received salary support and funding for this trial from LactoPharma, New Zealand.
